      <li>“Human capital—encompassing cognitive skills and personality traits—is critical for labor market success, yet the personality component remains difficult to measure at scale. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and comprehensive LinkedIn microdata, we extract the Big 5 personality traits from facial images of 96,000 MBA graduates, and demonstrate that this novel ``Photo Big 5’’ predicts school rank, compensation, job seniority, industry choice, job transitions, and career advancement. Using administrative records from top-tier MBA programs, we find that the Photo Big 5 exhibits only modest correlations with cognitive measures like GPA and standardized test scores, yet offers comparable incremental predictive power for labor outcomes.”</li>

Originally from Russia, Durov, the only tech CEO on the list, obtained Emirati citizenship, ironically earning him the leading spot in the Arab billionaires club. Durov is not the only non-Arab to make it to the list. A group of Indian tycoons residing in the UAE also joined, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/renuka-jagtiani/">Renuka Jagtiani</a>, the first businesswoman to make the list. These foreign entries have pushed Arab billionaires down the rankings. “</li>

There are numerous psycholinguistic studies that show this. Famous are those of the American psychologist John Bargh, who had half of his test subjects make sentences with words such as assertive, rude and interrupt, and others with patience, politeness and respect. After the test, the test subjects had to log out of someone who was busy talking. Two-thirds of the ‘assertive’ group interrupted the research leader. In the ‘polite’ group, this was only sixteen percent.”</p>

        <p>“When it comes to dilution, I generally advise founders to target selling between 10% to at most 30% of the company in early rounds (if raising on a SAFE, determined based off the ‘post-money cap’).

        <p>“Our assumptions about indirect deaths vary significantly across programs, ranging from ~5 indirect deaths averted for each direct death averted for vitamin A supplementation (VAS), 0.75 for malaria and vaccines, and ~2 for water chlorination. We have not thoroughly assessed whether these magnitudes, or their relative sizes across top charities, are plausible.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This was pretty shocking to me, not only that the estimates warrant much more assesment, but also the initial estimates, where malaria and vaccination is much less potent in secondary death aversion than much simpler interventions, like vitamin supplementation and water chlorination.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.plasticlist.org/report">PlasticList Report</a>. Lot of pretty concerning findings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>“Samples of 22 products, from vendors ranging from Starbucks to Shake Shack to Whole Foods, exceeded the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) intake limits for Bisphenol A. The excess amounts ranged from 450% to 32,571% of EFSA limits for a 70 kg (154 lb) person.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“[A]lmost all of today’s safety limits for the chemicals we tested are based on old NOAELs. For example, the EPA safety limit for DEHP in 2024 is based on a 1953 study.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“Phthalate exposure may also interfere with brain development. A 2014 study from Factor-Litvak et al. studied 328 mother-child pairs and found that phthalate metabolites in maternal urine correlated with Wechsler IQs 6-7 points lower at age 7, across genders.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“If BPS really is a regrettable substitution for BPA, then the levels detected in receipts are very high – 547,785,000% of the EFSA daily limit for BPA and 2,191% of the EPA limit, to be precise. The real BPS limit would probably be different from BPA, but considering that dermal absorption of BPA is higher than dietary absorption, the levels in the receipts would almost certainly far surpass any safety limit.”</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While the authors concluded that they are not changing their behavior substantially, I am now certainly upset that my bio tomatoes and bio peppers are plastic-packed, and not taking receipts anymore.</p>
