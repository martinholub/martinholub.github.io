    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hugo_Loudon">John Hugo Loudon</a> was the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell from 1952 to 1965 and later served as the president of the World Wide Fund for Nature from 1977 to 1981. He was known for promoting equality in the workforce during his tenure at Shell.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Shell, to me, is a very interesting company. Fallen into popular contempt, it still remains one of the greatest things the Dutch have built. I believe a lot of its controversies started with very good intentions. Check my article on the company <a href="https://www.martinholub.com/2025/01/08/Shell.html">here</a>. E.g. “Shell has argued that it is already taking “serious steps to reduce emissions”. It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers’ choices. Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.” — from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx240l9xq2yo">here</a>.</li>

        <li>
          <p>In addition, greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced with GTL systems through the input of CO2 streams as co-feed which is converted into gasoline or methanol, representing a valuable use for what is typically considered a low-value or even negative-value gas stream. Properties of GTL Fuel include the enhanced aquatic and soil biodegradability, lower aquatic and soil ecotoxicity. Fuels produced from the FT process offer significantly better performance than their petroleum-based equivalents. FT-derived diesel does not contain aromatics or sulfur, and it burns cleaner than petroleum-derived fuels, resulting in lower emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx) and particulates. Exhaust emissions experiments on GTL products revealed an overall significant reduction of CO (22%–25%), hydrocarbons (30%–40%) and NOx (6% to 8%). GTL diesel has the potential to be sold as a premium blendstock.</p>

The lack of storage has historically meant that electrical generation must match supply on a minute-by-minute basis, which incentivized having large, connected power grids to smooth out variations in demand and reduce the requirements for infrastructure.”</li>

The learning curve is the observation that production costs tend to fall by a constant percent every doubling of production volume. […] With TI’s high yields, the company’s manufacturing costs are already lower than its competitors, so Chang decides to regularly reduce the price of integrated circuits to put the screws to the competition and try to capture market share.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The biggest surprise from talking to Chinese VCs people at AI labs was how capital constrained they felt. Moonshot AI, one of China’s leading AI labs, raised $1 billion at a $3 billion valuation. Meanwhile, just xAI’s new cluster alone will cost $3-4 billion. The tech ecosystem feels quite shell shocked from the 2021 crackdown. One VC half-jokingly asked if I could help him get his money out of China. If you keep your money in China, you’re basically stuck choosing between terrible options. You can either accept a measly 2% yield from state banks, or throw it into China’s perpetually struggling stock market. This helps explain why valuations for Chinese companies are chronically low - the exit opportunities just suck. Even if you build (or invest in) something great, there’s no guarantee the company will be able to raise the next round. And even if you do raise again and succeed, the government might randomly cancel your IPO. And even if you somehow make it to the public markets, Chinese equities have been performing terribly anyways. It’s a good reminder of how easy it is to completely wreck an innovation ecosystem that depends on risk-taking investors.</p>
