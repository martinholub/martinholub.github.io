<p>Hello TU Delft iGEM Supervisors and Organizers!</p>

<p>I am Martin and this page is my application for the coming year’s TU Delft iGEM team as a supervisor! I would be more than thrilled to contribute to the to efforts of TU Delft in iGEM competitions as a supervisor and thereby also help to spread the word for synthetic biology! I have a passion for mentoring teams and I thus believe I can make a positive contribution to the development of the team and their project.</p>

<p>I am a fresh PhD student at the Bionanoscience department in the group of Cees Dekker and I will be investigating the building principles of circular chromosomes. Although basic science per se, this project has direct connections to synthetic biology, be it to building functional biomolecular systems from bottom up or designing and understanding synthetic chromosomes <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Trained as an engineer and turned into biologist, my long-term goal is to make engineering with biology easy and contribute to the efforts to understand and harness Nature’s machinery.</p>

<p>I have both wet lab and dry lab experience under my belt and not only within courses but also as internships and research projects. Here are some examples:</p>

<h3 id="wet-lab">Wet Lab</h3>
<p><br />
In my PhD, I am experimentally studying spatio-temporal organization of genome-scale DNA in man-made compartments under various effects including protein binding and confinement.</p>

</div>
<div class="col three caption"> Compaction of DNA by a binding protein </div>

<p>In my recently finished master thesis I developed a method for noncontact measurement of temperature on nanoscale using ideas from electrochemistry and scanning probe microscopy. The project resulted in a manuscript and the results were presented in a talk at a conference. Most of my days on the project were spent in the lab, running experiments and developing the technique and instrumentation. Other days, I ran multiphysics simulations to get better understanding of the phenomena I observed.</p>

SICM (Scanning ion conductance microscopy) topography (a, c) and thermometry (b, d) in absence (a, b) and presence (c, d) of plasmonic heating. The data in absence of heating shows excellent correspondence with AFM scan, e) height, f) phase. For the heated nanoparticle substrate, the evolution of stable bubble that serves as heat insulator next to the bigger deposit was observed. </div>

<p><br />
While doing a semester project in Biofabrication and Tissue Engineering Lab I worked on system for microextrusion of cell laden biomaterials. I improved accuracy of the 3D bioprinting process while getting skills in cell culture, immunohistochemistry, PCR, viability assays and biofabrication.</p>

<p>I also worked in microfluidics when I fabricated and tested a chip for a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00776">portable array of 64 sensors</a> for point-of-care applications. Here are some photos:</p>

<h3 id="dry-lab">Dry Lab</h3>
<p><br />
I am fluent in Python, Matlab and R. Here are some examples of analysis of next-generation sequencing data I did:</p>

<p>Most recently, I worked 8 months full-time as an intern in bioinformatics in ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) Zürich <a href="https://nebion.com/">spin-off company</a>. My work consisted mainly in developing pipelines for processing big data from sequencing experiments, relying on command-line interface and using tools like Snakemake, or exploiting concepts from machine learning to automate annotation of the data. I was interacting with both computer scientists and biologists on daily basis.</p>

<h3 id="other-skills--experience">Other Skills &amp; Experience</h3>
<p><br />
As a past member of <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters International</a>, I am skilled in presenting and public speaking and I enjoy helping others to craft their presentations and stories for higher impact. In my first year at ETH, I gave the final pitch at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/sustainability/ETHweek.html">ETH Week</a> which secured our team the prize for <em>The Most Fascinating Science</em>.</p>

<p>In 2018, I returned back to ETH Week as a Tutor to coach a team of 8 students on their week-long journey to develop a porotype of a product addressing pressing environmental challenges. Among others, I had to learn how to manage their motivation and time. I got thoroughly trained and exposed to concept of designing thinking, learning how to coach a team in innovation process. My biggest reward was a cohesive team has even decided to remain together after the event to pursue the development of their prototype over the coming semester! I believe that such training would prove very useful when supervising the iGEM team!</p>

<div class="col three caption"> The WattsUp! team at ETH Week 2018 </div>

<p>I have collected experience in team-work even before starting my bachelor, when I served for one year as a coach of a 20+ member Ultimate Frisbee sports club with people in age range of 15 to 35 years. During my bachelor, I co-organized a career fair for 3500+ students and I managed a team of about 50 hostesses and logistic assistants.</p>

<p>I am also able to help the team with wiki mark-up as I have written multiple contributions for in-class wiki pages and I can find my way around in setting up webpages (like this one) :).</p>

<p>iGEM is in its nature an engineering competition and as a maker and hacker, I will be able to support the team with an enineering mindset. I love working on a difficult problem and using whatever tools necessary to achieve desired goal. I can design and print objects with 3D printer and have participated in HackZurich (the biggest hackathon in Europe) and OpenFoodData Hackadays where <a href="http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/bern/story/App-soll-Weg-des-Steaks-von-Stall-bis-Teller-zeigen-28948666">our team</a> was selected for financial support and business development. Most recently, I joined a team at MakeZurich 2018 and <a href="http://www.martinholub.com/eth/code/2018/08/05/MakeZurich.html">prototyped a device for remote monitoring of pharmaceutical deliveries</a>. It was a success, the development of the product was further pursued by a Swiss start-up company specializing on last-mile delivery.</p>

<h2 id="me-as-tu-delft-igem-supervisor">Me as TU Delft iGEM Supervisor</h2>
<p><br />
I am fascinated by molecular biology and firmly convinced that synthetic biology offers a unique opportunity to better align human pursuits with Nature’s interests. As a scientist, I am playing the long game and focusing on furthering our understanding of biological systems, but I am simultaneously motivated by implications for biological engineering. My goal is to contribute to making biology easy to engineer for various applications and to raise awareness about the benefits (and risks) of synthetic biology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning.” (Steve Jobs)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am aware of iGEM for over two years now and I have been even nominated for ETH 2019 team (the application process is quite selective there)! I unfortunately could not participate because the iGEM timeline was partly overlapping with my thesis project (which received a priority) and my degree program deadline was expiring in September. I have however closely followed the competition and the progress of ETH team throughout and the fact that I was nominated among many applicants evidences of my suitability for the competition.</p>

<p>I am aware that TU Delft has a great track record at iGEM and as I am joining TU Delft for about 4 years, I think that it may be a fantastic opportunity for me to contribute to it, even over several years. Not as a member anymore, but rather as a mentor and supervisor, guiding the team in its development and helping them to craft and execute their very own project in synthetic biology as well as surmount challenges that come with such competition! I am interested mainly in the teaching and learning experience and do not expect to receive any credit for my contributions (although some GCS’s maybe useful).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Research is the process of going up alleys to see if they’re blind.” (Marston Bates)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Importantly, I have been working hard on my <em>songwriting skills</em> lately such that TU Delft can produce iGEM music video on its own as well :D</p>

</div> -->

<p><br />
To conclude, I believe that my motivation and enthusiasm coupled with interdisciplinary training that spans engineering, biology and team mentorship will allow me to efficiently contribute to the TU Delft iGEM 2020 project, both on technical and soft-skills level. I will be excited to see the team and its project develop over the course of the half a year preceding the competition and I am eager to help them with designing a novel biological system, translating it to DNA and testing it while having lots of fun.</p>

<p>If my application sparks your interest, I will be more than happy to meet in person to further discuss my participation as a supervisor :).</p>
