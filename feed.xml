&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-revenue start-up valuation needn’t be a mystery!  🚀 💲 Here are the three most common start-up pre-money valuation methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-the-scorecard-aka-bill-payne-method&quot;&gt;💰 The Scorecard (aka Bill Payne) method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starts from average start-up valuation (for comparable stage, industry, size, …), and multiples it by a subjective weighted factor that considers team, timing, size of the opportunity, technology/product (e.g. IP, network effects, …), competitive environment (e.g. barriers to entry), partnerships/sales/rollout, … (and sometimes a bit more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-example-&quot;&gt;An example 🔎:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-revenue startups similar to startup A are valued on average at $1.86M. We subjectively assign the following weights (must sum up to 100%) to the following factors: team (35%), timing &amp;amp; size of the opportunity (25%), technology/product (20%), competitive environment (10%), partnerships (10%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then score the startup on these metrics relative to the industry average:  team (140%), timing &amp;amp; size of the opportunity (150%), technology/product (89%), competitive environment (67%), partnerships (81%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighting these scores and summing up, we obtain a multiplier for the pre-money valuation relative to industry average: 140%*35% + 150%*25% + 89%*20% + 67%*10% + 81%*10% = 1.191. Finally, the pre-money valuation for this startup is: 1.86*1.191 = $2.215M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Weights&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Weights * Score&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Team&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.35&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.40&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.35*1.40=.49&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Timing &amp;amp; Opportunity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.25&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.50&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.25*1.50=.375&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Technology&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.20&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.89&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.20*.89=.178&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Competitive Environment&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.67&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.10*.67=.067&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Partnerships&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.81&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.10*.81=.081&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.191&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-the-vc-method&quot;&gt;💰 The “VC” method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First determines the post-money valuation as terminal value / expected ROI. The pre-money valuation is then post-money valuation - investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-example--1&quot;&gt;An example 🔎:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup B anticipates exit in 5 years at $60M (based on current market data and future projections). VCs anticipate an ROI of 15x (this is commonly 10-30x, sometimes up to 100x for early stage investments). The post-money valuation is then 60/15 = $4M. Given a sought investment of $1M, the pre-money valuation of this startup is $3M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-the-berkus-method&quot;&gt;💰 The Berkus method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigns value between 0 and $500k for the following five factors: team, idea, working prototype, board/strategic relationships/partnerships, rollout/sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-example--2&quot;&gt;An example 🔎:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup C has a very good and fast team ($400k), compelling idea ($300k), working prototype and a demo ($500k), has not established marketing/supplier relationships, but has sound board ($250k), and has not rolled out a product or receive first sale yet ($0). The pre-money valuation of this startup is 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.25 = $1.45M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a to-do list is a practical and effective way to free mental capacity and avoid forgetting tasks that you may have to execute at work and other domains of your life. To-do lists are great. In fact, and I am very sure I would be incapable of keeping track of all the tasks I may have to do, wasn’t it for keeping a to-do list. I may not have even written this post. To-do lists are probably one of the simplest productivity hacks out there. You should absolutely write them. But you should &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; write them unless you write a different list first. It’s what I call &lt;strong&gt;to-be&lt;/strong&gt; list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-to-be-list-and-what-is-on-mine&quot;&gt;What is a to-be list, and what is on mine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting sh*t done is cool, but we all know there are more important things out there. Like realizing your full potential and being a kind human being. That’ what the to-be list is there to help you with. Unlike a to-do list, you write it once and then you rarely change it. It should have just a handful of items (say maximum twelve) and they will be deeply personal. The main purpose of a to-be list is to first figure out what kind of person you want to be, and then help you be one.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every to-be list is unique, but for the sake of inspiration, here is what is on mine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emotional generosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infectious enthusiasm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social courage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intellectual curiosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relentless resourcefulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional generosity&lt;/strong&gt; is living with your heart open, letting your feelings and emotions be seen, but also creating space to listen and fully apprehend those of others.  &lt;strong&gt;Infectious enthusiasm&lt;/strong&gt; is creating an atmosphere of joy around everything you do and sharing it with others.
&lt;strong&gt;Social courage&lt;/strong&gt; is asking for what you want and speaking up to fight injustice. &lt;strong&gt;Intellectual curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; is about understanding the world around you as much as you can, without making assumptions about it (and other people’s opinions about it). &lt;strong&gt;Relentless resourcefulness&lt;/strong&gt; is being maximally helpful anytime you get chance to – a friend of a friend is looking for new home? You ask around. A friend travels to a city you have been to? You share your favorite places to visit. A colleague is stuck with a work task? You offer to troubleshoot and brainstorm together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-you-write-your-to-be-list&quot;&gt;Will you write your to-be list?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t always manage to live up to my to-be list but having one certainly does help me to do it more frequently. In a world where the word ambition has become almost uniquely associated with career, I find it very important to remind myself that ambitions for one’s character are much more important.
If you agree, I encourage you to write a to-be list of your own, maybe taking an inspiration from mine, but more importantly reflecting your own unique experience and character.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you are exceptionally creative, you could weave your to-be list into a small poem and maybe say it out loud each morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am curious – what would be in your to-be list? And why? Let me know in the comments and thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

You can watch the excerpt here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hxeDjAxvJ8?si=Ium65Pj10vMVCsCk&amp;amp;start=9835&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- https://www.chunkhang.com/blog/responsive-youtube-video-with-jekyll use as include youtube.html id=&apos;....&apos;  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lot of respect for Marc Andreessen. He is a techno-optimist and visionary as well as very clear and opiniated thinker. No one can predict the future, but he gives it a fair shot for some things, and I will listen when he tries. I suggest checking his &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmarchive.com/&quot;&gt;archival blog&lt;/a&gt; for productivity and startup logistics resources, and some of his podcast appearances to learn more about how he thinks (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/marc-andreessen/&quot;&gt;Conversations with Tyler #152&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Marc Andreessen gives advice for how to identify good founders, or how to become one, it’s good to take a note. Here are the major points he discusses in the excerpt above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;characteristics-of-a-great-founder&quot;&gt;Characteristics of a great founder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation starts quite funny, when being asked what advice he would give to aspiring startup founder, Marc says, that he cannot really give any, because the really great founders don’t listen to advice. That is a catchy way to put it, but it intuitively seems true. Marc argues that founders who need to be guided by hand towards company creation are likely better off doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another catchy statement he highlights that there really is not a good way to reference check star-up founders who have not run a company before. The right reference you look for is “I would go work for that person”, but that’s not something the referees would be commonly thinking of saying.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other characteristics he mentions are being smart, energetic, and courageous. Where the last one, he argues, is a choice (more on this below).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-it-like-to-start-a-company&quot;&gt;What is it like to start a company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrepreneurial career is often romanticized, pictured almost as a discovery quest of new continent or planet (from there the oft-advertised imagery of spaceships, astronauts, and other explorers). The founder is depicted as someone with clear vision, leading an enthusiastic team towards a shared goal, which is some combination of world being a better place and everyone on the team affording a large house and a sports car (or a high-end caravan and a boat, if that’s your thing) just few years down the line, while enjoying weekly Friday happy hours and yearly company outings. While I think this is helpful to make more people attentive to the possibility of pursuing entrepreneurial career, it is also vital for exactly these people to realize that it’s mostly nothing like that.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen comments that the reality for founders is basically people repeatedly saying “no” to you, often followed by some version of “never” and “you are stupid”. “No, I won’t buy your product”, “No, I won’t leave my cushy job in a big company to go work for you”, “No, we won’t run a story about your company on social media”, are just some of the many options of how one can be rejected. Rejection is painful, it does take quite some training to prevent it from having you feel like sh*it for a week after receiving one, and you will never become completely immune to taking it personally.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you think that accepting one rejection blow after another is something you could deal with &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; – think of doing that, while grinning from cheek to cheek, joyfully welcoming your employees with a smile and chat about their wedding preparation plans, while also sharing enthusiasm and your vision with everyone from the janitor to your prospective funders. How easy does that sound? (Sorry to hear about your own cancelled engagement by the way! It turns out that with 80-hour work weeks there is little time left for great dates!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, starting a company is not a smooth ride, so you may even get some strange sense of gratitude once it goes under, which, &lt;em&gt;what a plot twist turning THIS into a happy ending!&lt;/em&gt;, it most likely will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-should-start-a-company&quot;&gt;Who should start a company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read the above, you must be wondering – is a great founder also a sociopath? Well kind of. According to Marc Andreessen, people who start companies should have a irresistible desire to see their solution on the market, a burning feeling that they cannot do otherwise but startup. This will hedge them against the many adversities they are bound to encounter – having their private life as well as their perceived self-worth challenged, they can always console themselves with the reminder that there was no other way (here you go, if your startup fails, you can become a stoic philosopher!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning desire seems important but will burn really really bright and fast if the tech is not solid. The would-be successful founders must have a great and specific technical product idea. No one should start a company on a vague vision of “transforming XYZ”, ”solving XYZ crisis”, or “making XYZ more sustainable”, no matter how noble or important this might seem. In fact, its probably better to forget about any grand vision until you have a working product that you are selling at a profit. You can get fancy with visions afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great and specific technical product idea is not a holy grail unless it also checks the boxes for the size of the opportunity, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html&quot;&gt;product-market fit&lt;/a&gt; and you are able &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grahamweaver.com/blog/threesurprisinglessons&quot;&gt;to build a great team&lt;/a&gt; around it, but all these topics are beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this leave you excited about entrepreneurship? Congratulations, you seem to be a masochist with large pain tolerance. The world needs you to go out there and get your hands dirty making some great products. Before you do so, you can learn more by reading Marc Andreessen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmarchive.com/index.html#guide-to-startups&quot;&gt;Guide to Startups&lt;/a&gt;. I will keep blogging on this and related topics using variety of resources, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinholub.com/subscribe/&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to stay updated and keep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this leave you thinking entrepreneurship is not for you? Congratulations, you may have saved yourself some grey hair and couple of good friends. Maybe more importantly (because reading this post you may be biased to starting up), it should give you an idea what place you want to be in to be comfortable being serous about staring up,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Note&lt;/b&gt;: It is not my intention to leave you thinking that starting up means giving up on any personal life. This tone was chosen to accentuate some ideas in relatable way. While it’s certainly possible to weigh heavily on the side of work in exchange for the private, people who are prone to do so will likely do it as employees as well. Building a sustainable business means building an environment people enjoy coming back to, and to become a great leader, you must accept the imperative to make your mental and physical wellbeing a priority. Finally, running a business is empowering and this can have large positive ramifications across all aspects of one’s life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I am of somewhat different opinion and believe it’s more of a habit as much as being energetic is one. More than that, I would also say that most people have large capacity to be both, energetic and courageous, and that making this a habitual state is mainly a subtractive process (of eliminating distractions, limiting beliefs and inner conflicts). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I am NOT speaking from personal experience. I do however have some second-hand experience through friends, and I am attentive to writing from founders that is on the internet.

      &lt;p&gt;It’s the, in this case mostly unfortunate, condition of human mind, that we will be struck more heavily by negative emotions and events than by the positive ones (that’s why all the news outlets seem like a catastrophe reel). While this was super-helpful to increase chances of survival of our species (finally a miracle you can truly put yourself behind), it is mostly maladaptive in today’s environment. Knowing this is only slightly helpful at moments when you are questioning your value as a human being after being rejected on some microscopically tiny aspect of your existence. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You can watch the excerpt here: I have lot of respect for Marc Andreessen. He is a techno-optimist and visionary as well as very clear and opiniated thinker. No one can predict the future, but he gives it a fair shot for some things, and I will listen when he tries. I suggest checking his archival blog for productivity and startup logistics resources, and some of his podcast appearances to learn more about how he thinks (e.g. Conversations with Tyler #152). When Marc Andreessen gives advice for how to identify good founders, or how to become one, it’s good to take a note. Here are the major points he discusses in the excerpt above: Characteristics of a great founder The conversation starts quite funny, when being asked what advice he would give to aspiring startup founder, Marc says, that he cannot really give any, because the really great founders don’t listen to advice. That is a catchy way to put it, but it intuitively seems true. Marc argues that founders who need to be guided by hand towards company creation are likely better off doing something else. In another catchy statement he highlights that there really is not a good way to reference check star-up founders who have not run a company before. The right reference you look for is “I would go work for that person”, but that’s not something the referees would be commonly thinking of saying.1 Other characteristics he mentions are being smart, energetic, and courageous. Where the last one, he argues, is a choice (more on this below).2 What is it like to start a company The entrepreneurial career is often romanticized, pictured almost as a discovery quest of new continent or planet (from there the oft-advertised imagery of spaceships, astronauts, and other explorers). The founder is depicted as someone with clear vision, leading an enthusiastic team towards a shared goal, which is some combination of world being a better place and everyone on the team affording a large house and a sports car (or a high-end caravan and a boat, if that’s your thing) just few years down the line, while enjoying weekly Friday happy hours and yearly company outings. While I think this is helpful to make more people attentive to the possibility of pursuing entrepreneurial career, it is also vital for exactly these people to realize that it’s mostly nothing like that.3 Marc Andreessen comments that the reality for founders is basically people repeatedly saying “no” to you, often followed by some version of “never” and “you are stupid”. “No, I won’t buy your product”, “No, I won’t leave my cushy job in a big company to go work for you”, “No, we won’t run a story about your company on social media”, are just some of the many options of how one can be rejected. Rejection is painful, it does take quite some training to prevent it from having you feel like sh*it for a week after receiving one, and you will never become completely immune to taking it personally.4 If you think you think that accepting one rejection blow after another is something you could deal with 5 – think of doing that, while grinning from cheek to cheek, joyfully welcoming your employees with a smile and chat about their wedding preparation plans, while also sharing enthusiasm and your vision with everyone from the janitor to your prospective funders. How easy does that sound? (Sorry to hear about your own cancelled engagement by the way! It turns out that with 80-hour work weeks there is little time left for great dates!) Clearly, starting a company is not a smooth ride, so you may even get some strange sense of gratitude once it goes under, which, what a plot twist turning THIS into a happy ending!, it most likely will.

Curiously, the model can provide an answer for many country pairs. Some are, however, censored out.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several things happened over the course of this Christmas holiday. First, Russia carried out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-massive-air-attack-ukraine-least-10-dead-kyiv-2023-12-29/&quot;&gt;largest air attack on Ukraine since the beginning of their offense&lt;/a&gt;. Second, a man shot fourteen university students dead, wounding 25 and killing himself in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Prague_shooting&quot;&gt;Prague mass school shooting&lt;/a&gt;. Third, I read a poem that tied the events together in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-ukraine-conflict&quot;&gt;Russia-Ukraine conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has been carrying out military offense on Ukraine for nearly two years now, with tens of thousands of causalities, immeasurable amount of human suffering and long lasting environmental and geopolitical consequences. Basic services are failing, and families are torn apart. The future potential of individuals as well as the country is radically diminished. Humans can, in one way or another, cope with just about anything, so life goes on. But those who will go through to see the end of it will emerge with unerasable animosity for the opponent.
I am Czech, and I don’t easily make friends with Russians. Don’t get me wrong, I have several Russian friends, some of them close ones. I have worked with many Russians and will do so in the future. I am willing to give anyone the benefit of doubt. However, anyone who I meet who is Russian will first undergo value-based scrutiny. I grew up in a former communist country, where the possibilities I had and the mindsets of people around me were crippled by the country’s history. I grew up on the backdrop of history of oppression, injustice, and fear. While many Czechoslovaks do carry the guilt of supporting the communist regime, it would have never emerged was it not for the territorial ambitions of the Soviets &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israel-palestine-conflict&quot;&gt;Israel-Palestine conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am also wary of Israelis. After a Hamas’ terrorist attack in early October 2023, Israel has launched a massive offensive targeting the Gaza Strip &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. It’s disguised as a revenge, but it is more than that. One thing is demanding some just settlement after violent action of Hamas’, the other is jumping at it as a pretext for perpetuating genocide. Over 1’500 Israeli and international soldiers and civilians were killed in the operation so far, while the death count on the Palestinian side surpasses 21’000. 
I am at loss of words to describe either the violence that happens there, or my helplessness over the international lapse to prevent this escalation. A year ago I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://leidenshorts.nl/film/image-of-victory/&quot;&gt;a short movie&lt;/a&gt; that is a great artist expression of criticism for the conflict, and something I come back to frequently to find some framework for coping with current events. The movie begins with a 2004 military offensive in Gaza, where a soldier is injured. The move then goes ahead following his recovery in an Isreali hospital. He is visited by tens of people, including Bar Rafeli and the Israeli defense minister, and touted as a war hero. Subtly, an impression of utter farce and futility surfaces &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terror-close-to-home&quot;&gt;Terror close to home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ongoing armed conflicts described above sound dreadful for anyone, soldiers and civilians alike. But it is very difficult for any of us who are not directly affected by the conflict to imagine what it must be like to experience this terror firsthand. 
Just before Christmas, a 24-year old man shot 14 university students dead, injuring 25 before killing himself in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Prague_shooting&quot;&gt;worst mass shooting of the modern Czech history&lt;/a&gt;. Czech Republic is a country of 10 million – that’s not necessarily small. 14 is ballpark one in a million. Yet when terrible things like this happen, you understand how close we actually are. Almost anyone will, directly, or indirectly, know someone who is affected. A friend of a friend died in hospital with bullet hole in their skull and someone I know nearly ended up being at the location of shooting, at the time it happened, was it not for a coincidental plan change. And I don’t even live in the city where it happened, heck, I have been living abroad for seven years by now.
The shooting happened just before Christmas holidays, and I went to its location several days after to light a candle and pay memory to the victims. As I stood there, overlooking the building where it happened and the square it faces, I closed my eyes. As soon as I did that, I could not find the imagery of people running away in panic. The imaginary sounds of shots fired resonating between the buildings on the square sent shivers up my spine. It felt terrible, but all that was just a fraction of how people that were present there when it happened must have felt, and that in itself was at least as bad as what people who live in areas of armed conflict must go through on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silence-is-a-statement&quot;&gt;Silence is a statement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, no one in their sane mind who has both feet on the ground would wish for armed violence to continue for a second longer. And let’s be fair, we don’t. But what has any of us done to express this sentiment? Are we mounting massive protests? Do we send financial support for humanitarian efforts in war struck regions? Do we put fierce and relentless pressure on our governments to do all they can to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on the perpetuators of the conflict? No, for the most part we don’t do any of that. I am myself employed at a major university in the Netherlands. Nowhere on the campus there are any signs of support for either Ukraine or Palestine. In the many months following the beginning of the conflict, no public statements to condemn the violence have been made. I find this extremely frustrating. Are leaders too afraid of being cancelled for taking a political stance? Only recently I realized one sad truth – not making a statement, is a statement of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-poem&quot;&gt;The poem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I told you about three things that happened, and those were two so far. The last one is a poem I read, that ties the two together. I will just leave you here with it to see how it does that for yourself (click &lt;a href=&quot;https://onbeing.org/programs/ilya-kaminsky-we-lived-happily-during-the-war/&quot;&gt;this link if you want to hear it narrated&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the very same reasons, I am also more wary of Germans, but to much smaller extent. Knowing many of them well, I know they have done a lot of soul searching and retrospection over the past decades, clearly demonstrating the departure from mindsets that perpetuated the World Wars. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The tension is there to stay. Either party finds themselves to be more in right than the other (see interviews with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry6kpYFHnxs&amp;amp;ab_channel=CoreyGil-Shuster&quot;&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhSHTJr8S64&amp;amp;t=199s&amp;amp;ab_channel=CoreyGil-Shuster&quot;&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt;), and I am in no way an arbiter of who is more right and who is not when it comes to the territorial conflict. I do however stand behind the statement that Israel is committing ethnic cleansing and that internationally we must require our leaders to call it what it is and to work to stop it as soon as possible. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it is very difficult for any of us who are not directly affected by the conflict to imagine what it must be like to experience this terror firsthand. Just before Christmas, a 24-year old man shot 14 university students dead, injuring 25 before killing himself in the worst mass shooting of the modern Czech history. Czech Republic is a country of 10 million – that’s not necessarily small. 14 is ballpark one in a million. Yet when terrible things like this happen, you understand how close we actually are. Almost anyone will, directly, or indirectly, know someone who is affected. A friend of a friend died in hospital with bullet hole in their skull and someone I know nearly ended up being at the location of shooting, at the time it happened, was it not for a coincidental plan change. And I don’t even live in the city where it happened, heck, I have been living abroad for seven years by now. The shooting happened just before Christmas holidays, and I went to its location several days after to light a candle and pay memory to the victims. As I stood there, overlooking the building where it happened and the square it faces, I closed my eyes. As soon as I did that, I could not find the imagery of people running away in panic. The imaginary sounds of shots fired resonating between the buildings on the square sent shivers up my spine. It felt terrible, but all that was just a fraction of how people that were present there when it happened must have felt, and that in itself was at least as bad as what people who live in areas of armed conflict must go through on a regular basis. Silence is a statement Clearly, no one in their sane mind who has both feet on the ground would wish for armed violence to continue for a second longer. And let’s be fair, we don’t. But what has any of us done to express this sentiment? Are we mounting massive protests? Do we send financial support for humanitarian efforts in war struck regions? Do we put fierce and relentless pressure on our governments to do all they can to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on the perpetuators of the conflict? No, for the most part we don’t do any of that. I am myself employed at a major university in the Netherlands. Nowhere on the campus there are any signs of support for either Ukraine or Palestine. In the many months following the beginning of the conflict, no public statements to condemn the violence have been made. I find this extremely frustrating. Are leaders too afraid of being cancelled for taking a political stance? Only recently I realized one sad truth – not making a statement, is a statement of its own. The poem So I told you about three things that happened, and those were two so far. The last one is a poem I read, that ties the two together. I will just leave you here with it to see how it does that for yourself (click this link if you want to hear it narrated): Poem by Ilya Kaminsky from his 2019 collection Deaf Republic. Image taken from ericweinste.in. For the very same reasons, I am also more wary of Germans, but to much smaller extent. Knowing many of them well, I know they have done a lot of soul searching and retrospection over the past decades, clearly demonstrating the departure from mindsets that perpetuated the World Wars. &amp;#8617; The tension is there to stay. Either party finds themselves to be more in right than the other (see interviews with Palestinians and Israeli), and I am in no way an arbiter of who is more right and who is not when it comes to the territorial conflict. I do however stand behind the statement that Israel is committing ethnic cleansing and that internationally we must require our leaders to call it what it is and to work to stop it as soon as possible. &amp;#8617;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">26 Lessons on How to Run a Business from the Book ‘The Personal MBA’</title><link href="https://www.martinholub.com//business/startup/2024/01/05/PersonalMBA.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="26 Lessons on How to Run a Business from the Book ‘The Personal MBA’" /><published>2024-01-05T07:16:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-01-05T07:16:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.martinholub.com//business/startup/2024/01/05/PersonalMBA</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.martinholub.com//business/startup/2024/01/05/PersonalMBA.html">&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/personalmba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;mba&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us out there in the tech and business world will consider pursuing an MBA at one point. While this can be a rewarding experience, it comes with a hefty price tag and equally significant opportunity cost. There are plenty of reasons for pursuing a full-fledged program (social capital and prestigious stamp are just a few), but for many, a shorter course and real-world practice will do well. I am a big proponent of self-reliance and thus was delighted to learn about the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9512985-the-personal-mba&quot;&gt;The Personal MBA: A World-Class Business Education in a Single Volume&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in how businesses work, or even considering pursuing MBA, this book a is a great starting point. Below you will find a selection of my personal major takeaways. If you find these interesting, certainly check the author’s website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://personalmba.com/&quot;&gt;personalmba.com&lt;/a&gt; (it’s also a great source of witty quotes). Without further ado, some things I learnt about running businesses by reading this book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;efficient-processes-are-key-to-sustainable-businesses&quot;&gt;Efficient processes are key to sustainable businesses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process improvements don’t help the immediate bottom line, but they are essential to long-term business viability. Stray free of the other extreme, overoptimization. Good loose system beats a tight-one. While the former is less efficient, the latter requires numerous exceptions which still won’t prevent it from failing in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-companies-are-sexy&quot;&gt;Small companies are sexy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U. S. Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms in the United States, employ half of all private-sector workers, have generated 64 percent of net new jobs over the past fifteen years, and create more than 50 percent of U.S. nonfarm gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You don’t have to create next Amazon or Tesla to have huge positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;businesses-are-not-rocket-science&quot;&gt;Businesses are not rocket science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A business 1) provides something of value, that 2) other people want, 3) at a price they are willing to pay, 4) in a way that satisfies or exceeds their expectations, while 5) generating sufficient revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The milestone between a project and a business is first financially profitable transaction. Keep eye on the prize and get it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-should-satisfy-one-or-more-fundamental-human-drives&quot;&gt;Product should satisfy one or more fundamental human drives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drives are the drive to Acquire, the drive to Bond, the drive to Learn, the drive to Defend, the drive to Feel.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Clearly articulate how your product ties to one or more of these drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evaluate-market-potential-of-your-idea&quot;&gt;Evaluate market potential of your idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On scale 0 to 10, score the following: 1) How badly do people want or need your product right now? 2) How many people are purchasing things like this already?, 3) What is the highest price consumers would pay for this?, 4) How much will it cost to acquire new customers, 5) How much does it cost to create and deliver your product?, 6) How unique is your offer? 7) How quickly can you start selling something?, 8) How much you have to invest before you can make and sell your product? 9) How easy it is to generate secondary sales from the primary product? (if you sell an enzyme, can you sell reagent kits or experiment kits with it as well?), 10) How much work does your product require to keep delivering value? (in-person training requires a lot, a prerecorded online programme requires none).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;competition-is-a-gift&quot;&gt;Competition is a gift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding to enter to otherwise equal markets, enter the one with competition, that way you know there are consumers for your offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn how competitors deliver value is to become their customer.
The best way to beat your rivals is to make them irrelevant. Don’t focus on competing, focus on making a killer product. Remember, in words of Paul Graham: &lt;em&gt;“If in doubt, work on the product.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-less-obvious-ways-to-create-economic-value&quot;&gt;Some less obvious ways to create economic value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared resource&lt;/strong&gt; – lab space, a gym, …. Create and manage a durable asset that multiple parties use, and charge for access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An agency&lt;/strong&gt; – literary and real estate agents, … Collect, manage, market and sell an asset or service on other people’s behalf, and collect a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option&lt;/strong&gt; – tickets, … Offer customers the possibility of taking some action in the future, at predefined prices, without obliging them to do so. In other words, charge for providing flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience aggregation&lt;/strong&gt; – mailing lists, social media, … Create community with certain set of characteristics. Get and keep their attention by providing something they value. Provide access to this community to third parties and charge for the access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more obvious ways are: service, product, subscription, lease, loan, insurance, capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-generating-and-sharing-mock-ups-and-prototypes&quot;&gt;Keep generating and sharing mock-ups and prototypes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are much more likely to get funded if you can show a demo or prototype. Sharing it with customers is the best way how to get feedback. These benefits significantly outweigh the risk of competition jumping on your idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quicker you generate new versions of demo’s and the quicker you collect feedback on them, the faster you will start delivering a product of value. Internal testing counts too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-pre-orders-and-shadow-testing-to-gauge-your-product-market-fit&quot;&gt;Use pre-orders and shadow-testing to gauge your product-market fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you working on a product and do you want to have reliable data on who is out there to buy it? Create opportunity to preorder or a mock-up website and collect information on people who commit to purchase. Beware: be honest and perfectly transparent about the current readiness of your offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-trade-offs&quot;&gt;Make trade-offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product can be convenient or it can be high-end. It can address a pain point immediately, or focus on something more subtle and deliver value over time. Rarely it will be able to do both equally well. You will thus need to make trade-offs, and that’s a good thing. Focus on trade-offs that maximize the strengths of your offering, and satisfy the needs of your customers. To find out the latter: ask them to make explicit A/B trade-offs for key characteristic of your offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once marketing your product, verbalize your offering’s major strength in a hook. Good hooks are one-liners such as &lt;em&gt;“1000 songs in your pocket”&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;“The 20-Minute Body”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-true-marketing-value-of-social-media&quot;&gt;The true marketing value of social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered why the ads you are getting on Instagram are so interesting? That’s because they are tailored to yours truly. To use marketing budget effectively, target groups of prospects who are likely to be interested in your product already. This extends beyond social media: always choose smaller targeted campaign over a general one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;permission-to-follow-up-is-the-second-best-thing-after-a-direct-sale&quot;&gt;Permission to follow-up is the second-best thing after a direct sale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your marketing campaign should have clear call to action. The primary objective is a sale. The second-best option is a follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquiring new prospects requires effort. It’s much easier to reach out to a contact who demonstrated interest earlier. Do so periodically, and absolutely do include former customers when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asking for permission to follow up, be super clear what customers should expect when they sign up (a weekly newsletter with one new productivity trick each week, etc …), and let customers explicitly state their interest in future purchase on sign-up (a pre-commitment strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-tips-for-effective-selling&quot;&gt;Some tips for effective selling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to your customer, and understand what are their pain points and needs. Then demonstrate how your product addresses them (if it does). Point to competition if it does not. (Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://nabeelqu.co/post-selling&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for a good primer on sales.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your prospect imagine what a life with your product would be like. You can do this with demos, testers, or testimonials and other stories. The most effective testimonials describe customer satisfaction despite original scepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offer-genuine-free-value&quot;&gt;Offer genuine free value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great way how to ask for permission to follow up, collect feedback, and allow your customer to image what a life with your product would be like. It also creates a reciprocal relationship, making your prospects more likely to buy from you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;selling-begins-when-prospects-say-no&quot;&gt;Selling begins when prospects say no&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling is the process identifying and eliminating customers’ barriers to purchase. “It’s too expensive?” Focus on value your offering delivers. “It is not exactly what I am looking for?” Share testimonials and case studies. “It can wait?” Educate on the counterfactuals.
To reduce frequency of no, offer risk reversal strategy (e.g. free returns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-just-meet-your-customers-expectations-exceed-them&quot;&gt;Don’t just meet your customer’s expectations, exceed them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perception of quality is performance minus expectations. Create performance that exceeds expectations by offering an unexpected benefit with your offer (a freebie, earlier delivery than advertised, …).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;treat-your-value-delivery-process-as-an-experiment&quot;&gt;Treat your value delivery process as an experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher your throughput, the more customers you can serve. To increase your throughput focus on streamlining your value delivery process and eliminating any unnecessary steps. To be able to do this, you should deliberately outline your whole value stream, and measure how changes to its parts affect your throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-focus-on-maximizing-short-term-profit&quot;&gt;Don’t focus on maximizing (short term) profit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, of course, must generate profit. But you will achieve better results by focusing on serving as many customers as possible while capturing modest value. While this reduces short term results, it will make your business much better situated for the long-term (that’s why Apple is not selling a $100’000 iPhone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should reinvest most of revenue that your business generates into its growth for the same reason. It will compound your profits and after several years you will be in much better position than would have been the case otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-seeking-funding-decide-on-what-enterprise-you-want-to-build&quot;&gt;Before seeking funding decide on what enterprise you want to build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unicorn that races to IPO and leaves you wealthy at the exit? You will very likely need lot of external capital. A self-sufficient business that has you free to make your own decisions? Avoid external dilutive financing as much as possible. This will also make it easier to reinvest your profits (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do accept funding, use it solely to acquire things that will grow your revenue and that you could not afford otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understand-your-emotions-around-entrepreneurship&quot;&gt;Understand your emotions around entrepreneurship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fears and anxieties stop us from doing things we wish to do. These mental patterns were designed to protect us from objectively bad things, such as being expelled from community or being eaten by predator. The world has dramatically changed since. Risks we are facing when following our (healthy and socially acceptable) dreams and passions are disproportionately smaller, yet they trigger the same levels of fear and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbalize these fears by sharing them out loud with someone or writing them down. Imagine yourself pursing your goals and make mental note of what inner conflicts this triggers. Deconstruct these conflicts by asking yourself how significant they are in the real world. There is a good chance that doing so will leave you both more relaxed and motivated for pursuing your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-a-personal-rd-budget&quot;&gt;Have a personal R&amp;amp;D budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the hustle and bustle of building and growing a business, you will have to keep in mind to put your wellbeing first. Assuming that is taken care of, you will also need to stay on top of the game in your field and as a manager. While you will learn a lot by doing, you can accelerate your growth by creating a personal R&amp;amp;D budget and spending it on anything that makes you more knowledgeable or productive. This includes classes, coaching, books, equipment and conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-teams-small-and-elite&quot;&gt;Keep teams small and elite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep teams small. Studies have shown that the most effective group size is somewhere between three and eight people.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keep teams in this size to reduce communication overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep teams elite. In words of Paul English: &lt;em&gt;“Any company can have only ten best people.”&lt;/em&gt; Focus on making this ten better than your competitors, and then capitalize on individuals’ strengths. You will beat your competition irrespective of their total size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-tips-for-effective-real-world-management&quot;&gt;Five tips for effective real-world management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recruit only as many people as you need to deliver in high quality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a clear vision and ambitious plan for achieving it. Revise the plan as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Treat people with respect and show appreciation for their effort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide your team with the best tools and don’t fraction their time with unnecessary meetings or distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure your performance and keep experimenting with process improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;any-repeated-task-can-benefit-from-automation&quot;&gt;Any repeated task can benefit from automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create checklists and SOPs to help both new and old employees to carry out tasks with more efficiency and less errors. Listen to your employees on what SOPs are needed. Steer clear of documents where effort to create and maintain them outweighs value they deliver. While automated systems reduce idiosyncratic errors, they can introduce systemic ones. Keep a finger on your processes’ pulse with unbiased and continuous sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-stress-tests&quot;&gt;Run stress tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally simulate what happens if you get 10x your daily visitor count, number of orders per week, a major recall, a major supplier goes out of business, etc…. Find ways how your value delivery chain fails in internal experiments, and safeguard against future real world crisis. You will learn that you should, as much as possible, avoid having a single point of failure (having one customer much larger than rest, single supplier of critical ingredient, etc …).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-fun&quot;&gt;Have fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read the above points, you probably noticed that they have you understanding yourself as a person, getting rid of self-defeating beliefs, carrying out experiments, working with bright and inspiring colleagues, all the while following your passion and making a positive change in the world. That’s a great career! So don’t forget to have fun and enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

This extends beyond social media: always choose smaller targeted campaign over a general one. Permission to follow-up is the second-best thing after a direct sale Your marketing campaign should have clear call to action. The primary objective is a sale. The second-best option is a follow up. Acquiring new prospects requires effort. It’s much easier to reach out to a contact who demonstrated interest earlier. Do so periodically, and absolutely do include former customers when doing so. When asking for permission to follow up, be super clear what customers should expect when they sign up (a weekly newsletter with one new productivity trick each week, etc …), and let customers explicitly state their interest in future purchase on sign-up (a pre-commitment strategy). Some tips for effective selling Listen to your customer, and understand what are their pain points and needs. Then demonstrate how your product addresses them (if it does). Point to competition if it does not. (Check this post for a good primer on sales.) Let your prospect imagine what a life with your product would be like. You can do this with demos, testers, or testimonials and other stories. The most effective testimonials describe customer satisfaction despite original scepticism. Offer genuine free value This is great way how to ask for permission to follow up, collect feedback, and allow your customer to image what a life with your product would be like. It also creates a reciprocal relationship, making your prospects more likely to buy from you in the future. Selling begins when prospects say no Selling is the process identifying and eliminating customers’ barriers to purchase. “It’s too expensive?” Focus on value your offering delivers. “It is not exactly what I am looking for?” Share testimonials and case studies. “It can wait?” Educate on the counterfactuals. To reduce frequency of no, offer risk reversal strategy (e.g. free returns). Don’t just meet your customer’s expectations, exceed them The perception of quality is performance minus expectations. Create performance that exceeds expectations by offering an unexpected benefit with your offer (a freebie, earlier delivery than advertised, …). Treat your value delivery process as an experiment The higher your throughput, the more customers you can serve. To increase your throughput focus on streamlining your value delivery process and eliminating any unnecessary steps. To be able to do this, you should deliberately outline your whole value stream, and measure how changes to its parts affect your throughput. Don’t focus on maximizing (short term) profit You, of course, must generate profit. But you will achieve better results by focusing on serving as many customers as possible while capturing modest value. While this reduces short term results, it will make your business much better situated for the long-term (that’s why Apple is not selling a $100’000 iPhone). You should reinvest most of revenue that your business generates into its growth for the same reason. It will compound your profits and after several years you will be in much better position than would have been the case otherwise. Before seeking funding decide on what enterprise you want to build An unicorn that races to IPO and leaves you wealthy at the exit? You will very likely need lot of external capital. A self-sufficient business that has you free to make your own decisions? Avoid external dilutive financing as much as possible. This will also make it easier to reinvest your profits (see above). If you do accept funding, use it solely to acquire things that will grow your revenue and that you could not afford otherwise. Understand your emotions around entrepreneurship Fears and anxieties stop us from doing things we wish to do. These mental patterns were designed to protect us from objectively bad things, such as being expelled from community or being eaten by predator. The world has dramatically changed since. Risks we are facing when following our (healthy and socially acceptable) dreams and passions are disproportionately smaller, yet they trigger the same levels of fear and arousal. Verbalize these fears by sharing them out loud with someone or writing them down. Imagine yourself pursing your goals and make mental note of what inner conflicts this triggers. Deconstruct these conflicts by asking yourself how significant they are in the real world. There is a good chance that doing so will leave you both more relaxed and motivated for pursuing your goals. Have a personal R&amp;amp;D budget In all the hustle and bustle of building and growing a business, you will have to keep in mind to put your wellbeing first. Assuming that is taken care of, you will also need to stay on top of the game in your field and as a manager. While you will learn a lot by doing, you can accelerate your growth by creating a personal R&amp;amp;D budget and spending it on anything that makes you more knowledgeable or productive. This includes classes, coaching, books, equipment and conferences. Keep teams small and elite Keep teams small. Studies have shown that the most effective group size is somewhere between three and eight people.3 Keep teams in this size to reduce communication overhead. Keep teams elite. In words of Paul English: “Any company can have only ten best people.” Focus on making this ten better than your competitors, and then capitalize on individuals’ strengths. You will beat your competition irrespective of their total size. Five tips for effective real-world management Recruit only as many people as you need to deliver in high quality. Have a clear vision and ambitious plan for achieving it. Revise the plan as you go. Treat people with respect and show appreciation for their effort. Provide your team with the best tools and don’t fraction their time with unnecessary meetings or distractions. Measure your performance and keep experimenting with process improvements. Any repeated task can benefit from automation Create checklists and SOPs to help both new and old employees to carry out tasks with more efficiency and less errors. Listen to your employees on what SOPs are needed. Steer clear of documents where effort to create and maintain them outweighs value they deliver. While automated systems reduce idiosyncratic errors, they can introduce systemic ones. Keep a finger on your processes’ pulse with unbiased and continuous sampling. Run stress tests Internally simulate what happens if you get 10x your daily visitor count, number of orders per week, a major recall, a major supplier goes out of business, etc…. Find ways how your value delivery chain fails in internal experiments, and safeguard against future real world crisis. You will learn that you should, as much as possible, avoid having a single point of failure (having one customer much larger than rest, single supplier of critical ingredient, etc …). Have fun As you read the above points, you probably noticed that they have you understanding yourself as a person, getting rid of self-defeating beliefs, carrying out experiments, working with bright and inspiring colleagues, all the while following your passion and making a positive change in the world. That’s a great career! So don’t forget to have fun and enjoy the ride.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is me, I mean you, but from the future. I have been out and about collecting some experience in the past few years and now I am coming around to share it with you such as you don’t have to spend so much time wondering in the dark in the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do I even start, you have just turned 20 and started a university, moved cities started meeting lot of new people. It’s great. Or is it? I know how you are feeling, you don’t like the degree major and are thinking of switching programs. Well my advice is, do it and don’t look back. There is so much to do, so why dwell on things you are not really excited about, with people that are not really your bunch? I know you will argument about “loosing” a year, but don’t worry! If you are putting yourself in a place of higher satisfaction and curiosity, you can hardly call that a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- This will be a common pattern: If you sense something is not quite right, if your body does not align with what your mind wants it to do, don’t downplay the corporal feeling. It is at least as important of a voice as that of your mind! --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be conscious about maintaining long-standing friendships. It’s great to meet new people especially if you either align with them very well or if they are very different from you. But in most cases, they are just as good as anyone else. Meeting them can become somewhat overwhelming and you can quickly loose touch with friends from your early phases of life. Well, that’s good for some, because trust me, some people you used to hang out with, were really not aiming upwards, but fair number is just all-right or even great, and they deserve much better than to be mostly buried under constant income of new acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memories and experiences are investments and travelling is one of the best way to collect them, so travel as much as you can afford. Saving money is good, but make travelling something you indulge on for the coming decade. I know, it seems difficult as the budget is tight but almost always there will be a room in it to travel. As soon as you are earning substantially more than to break even, just make it a rule to spend X% of it on exploring the world, and when I say world, I mean going outside of Europe. And yes, that means: take all the vacation you can! Nature beats cities but do get a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In coming years, there will be several times when you are faced with having to decide which position or project to choose in your studies or for work. The best advice I can give: focus first on working with people you want to be around with, focus second on the environment, and only after project. The way of progress in any science project is uncertain and the outcomes are by far not predictable. You may think one approach is going to work only to try it dozen of times to no avail and having to divert. While you can learn a lot hustling and getting deep into the subject matter, you will learn much more from the people around you. A supervisor who truly cares about your success and is willing to work with you as you develop to define what it means at given time is worth their worth in gold. You will think it’s a weakness, before you find out it’s a strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second best advice I can give: Allow the decision to sink into your body, and decide which way to turn based on how you feel! If you experience fear or anxiety it is likely still a good idea to go ahead. If you experience sadness, that’s how you now it’s a bad idea! Don’t let your mind tell you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow yourself to be loved. Whatever barriers you have built as protection that may have been necessary as you were growing up (and they, you can cut yourself some slack here, were) are not needed anymore. You will slowly deconstruct them over the decade, but you will keep tripping over them for a while. Instead of slowly chipping on them, seek to put yourself in positions where a bomb could explode in their vicinity (yes that means dare to be seen and to become vulnerable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so far this was a lot of “do that” “don’t do that” type of talk, but you should not get overly stressed about. You are actually doing lot of things right already and this advice is mainly to help you move along this path bit faster. Over the decade you will develop strong connection with your feelings and emotions, and you will find ways how to listen to them and share them with others. You will actually become pretty good in the latter and it will allow you to connect quite profoundly with people who are open to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also build a good connection with your own body. You will understand when and why it rejoices and when and why it hurts. You will learn to negotiate with it and care for it. You will learn to listen to it to get measure of your overall wellbeing. You will build a sustainable and varied fitness routine that will also aid your productivity. You will learn how to strain it to become stronger over time, without pushing it to overdrive or towards injury. Some of it you will learn alone, and some of it you will learn with others, and as you learn about others’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will learn to find satisfaction in doing hard things. You will work hard and you will do well thanks to it. You will make substantial contributions to other people’s work and make new contributions of your own. Numerous doors will open and you will build strong and supportive professional network. It won’t be always easy. It will take you a while to build a meaningful relationship with productivity – to perceive it not as an overly demanding boss and kind of an obsessive compulsion, but something you actually enjoy not only for the fruits of it, but also for the process. But you will get there, mostly, and that’s all you can ask for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh btw, yes you are allergic to histamine. And yes, do throw more parties!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year was the year when I started reading lot of essays. An essay is somewhat neglected writing form - it’s basically thinking laid bare, with an attempt to figure something out. The word essay itself comes from the French &lt;em&gt;essayer&lt;/em&gt; which means &lt;em&gt;to try&lt;/em&gt;. Now unless you are a philosophy geek, that does not sound terribly interesting. But wait, good essay happens to have one more important feature – it comes up with something surprising. Consequently, it is a (relatively) short form that reveals new ways to understand the world around you. Being a short form, it not only means you don’t have to deal with a whole book (and there is lot of them that waste 300+ pages to get one page worth of a point across), but also that authors who do not write books still can get a shot at expressing their thoughts through essays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read some twenty to thirty essays wide range of topics. Bellow I present the five that either felt the most relatable or challenged my exiting mental models the most. Dealing with topics as diverse as economic inequality, impostor syndrome, and transformational festivals, chances are you will love reading them too. So, without further ado, here are the five essays, with a favorite quote from each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-beyond-belief-erik-davis-2006&quot;&gt;5. Beyond Belief (Erik Davis, 2006)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably don’t have to remind you, we live in a consumerist society. That’s good and bad, but one aspect I became particularly frustrated about is that it puts us in a passive position where entertainment is being catered to us. Seems to not to be a problem, as our phones, computers, TVs and movie theaters are full with it, right? Well not quite, because I think it has important implications - disempowering most of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that most of us would be much happier in society where everybody plays and active and recognizable role in entertaining the rest. This is something that probably worked quite naturally when communities consisted of 50 people seated around one campfire. &lt;a href=&quot;https://burningman.org/&quot;&gt;Burning Man&lt;/a&gt;, a countercultural transformational festival held annually in Black Rock Desert (Nevada, US), is an attempt at more participatory society, and much more than that. Any attempt to describe it will probably fall short, but Erik Davis at least does it with extreme literally skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At its best, Burning Man twists authenticity and irony into a Möbius strip that never lets you know what side you’re on but always keeps you going. […] The specifically religious elements of the Burn are important not in themselves, but in relation to one another and to the less ethereal aspects of the festival: the carnality, the trash, the desert dust. This wider field of relations is not holistic but multiple: a promiscuous carnival of souls, a metaphysical flea-market, a demolition derby of reality constructs colliding in a parched void.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-learning-the-elite-class-aella-2022&quot;&gt;4. Learning the Elite Class (Aella, 2022)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is ambitious will inevitably find themselves surrounded by smart people, more often than one would like this may end up in experiences of imposter syndrome. Written as a story of fetish-researcher at posh party &lt;em&gt;Learning the Elite Class&lt;/em&gt; is probably its best description I read this year (and maybe thus far).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The next person I talk to is a startup founder; she’s working on some company that aims to help crypto companies deal with the legal system. I don’t understand most of what she says, but it still feels familiar - I got into crypto early and was around the edges of the formation of the cryptosphere, and the basic culture isn’t arcane to me. I have vague background intuitions around what sorts of things are scams and aren’t, the ways crypto carries risk, the way the public views it. When she uses words like “community” in relation to crypto, it touches lightly into a web of other concepts, and I feel I understand the nuance and implications of it.  She tells me she’s doing a fundraising round and it’s looking promising; her team is building an app that’s going into beta next week and she is flying to a conference tomorrow morning and she was in calls all day earlier fixing an emergency with bank payments not going through to one of her contractors. Her life seems intense to me, and I don’t understand how she’s here at this party looking lively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-how-to-do-great-work-paul-graham-2023&quot;&gt;3. How to Do Great Work (Paul Graham, 2023)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, and investor. He is not only a coder who made seminal contributions to the programming language Lisp, but perhaps more notably, he is one of the four founders of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt;. Y Combinator is probably the world most renown start up accelerator. It funded over 4’000 startups that now have combined valuation of 600 Billion USD. Companies that started through it include Airbnb, Codeacademy, Coinbase, Disqus, Dropbox, Reddit, Scribd, Stripe, and Twitch. In this essay, he distils advice on how to get great stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Take as much risk as you can afford.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-becoming-a-magician-autotranslucencecom-2018&quot;&gt;2. Becoming a Magician (autotranslucence.com, 2018)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essay on why going 10x improvements can be much better idea than 2x, at least where you really care. Illustrated on World Bodypainting Competition. Recommended for magicians, body-painters, and anyone who is less cerebral than Paul Graham (which is probably 99% of population).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t necessarily need to make nonlinear jumps in all aspects of our lives, particularly if (according to your values) making such a jump would require a sacrifice you don’t endorse. But for the things you care about most, or are causing you the most suffering, there is probably a nonlinear strategy that you will miss if you pay too close attention to the linear strategy you current have or that people recommend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-in-praise-of-idleness-bertrand-russell-1932&quot;&gt;1. In Praise of Idleness (Bertrand Russell, 1932)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bertrand Russell was a British mathematician and philosopher. He made seminal contributions to the field of logic, influencing the development of programming languages and design of computer systems. That it is more than almost anyone would attempt before claiming their right for peaceful retirement, but Bertrand Russel did not stop there, by far. Out of many other achievements, he is also the awardee oof 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature “in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought”. This is what his essay “In Praise of Idleness” is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Praise of Idleness” is a literary gem - skillfully penned, it is an argument to stop glorifying work, and value leisure more. Reading it makes one wonder how did we make so little progress on it since he wrote it (and if he is self-reflecting, as his numerous achievements likely required that he tolled for most of his adult life, putting leisure into background).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for the others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That’s good and bad, but one aspect I became particularly frustrated about is that it puts us in a passive position where entertainment is being catered to us. Seems to not to be a problem, as our phones, computers, TVs and movie theaters are full with it, right? Well not quite, because I think it has important implications - disempowering most of us. I am convinced that most of us would be much happier in society where everybody plays and active and recognizable role in entertaining the rest. This is something that probably worked quite naturally when communities consisted of 50 people seated around one campfire. Burning Man, a countercultural transformational festival held annually in Black Rock Desert (Nevada, US), is an attempt at more participatory society, and much more than that. Any attempt to describe it will probably fall short, but Erik Davis at least does it with extreme literally skill. “At its best, Burning Man twists authenticity and irony into a Möbius strip that never lets you know what side you’re on but always keeps you going. […] The specifically religious elements of the Burn are important not in themselves, but in relation to one another and to the less ethereal aspects of the festival: the carnality, the trash, the desert dust. This wider field of relations is not holistic but multiple: a promiscuous carnival of souls, a metaphysical flea-market, a demolition derby of reality constructs colliding in a parched void.” Link to the essay 4. Learning the Elite Class (Aella, 2022) Anyone who is ambitious will inevitably find themselves surrounded by smart people, more often than one would like this may end up in experiences of imposter syndrome. Written as a story of fetish-researcher at posh party Learning the Elite Class is probably its best description I read this year (and maybe thus far). “The next person I talk to is a startup founder; she’s working on some company that aims to help crypto companies deal with the legal system. I don’t understand most of what she says, but it still feels familiar - I got into crypto early and was around the edges of the formation of the cryptosphere, and the basic culture isn’t arcane to me. I have vague background intuitions around what sorts of things are scams and aren’t, the ways crypto carries risk, the way the public views it. When she uses words like “community” in relation to crypto, it touches lightly into a web of other concepts, and I feel I understand the nuance and implications of it. She tells me she’s doing a fundraising round and it’s looking promising; her team is building an app that’s going into beta next week and she is flying to a conference tomorrow morning and she was in calls all day earlier fixing an emergency with bank payments not going through to one of her contractors. Her life seems intense to me, and I don’t understand how she’s here at this party looking lively.” Link to the essay 3. How to Do Great Work (Paul Graham, 2023) Paul Graham is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, and investor. He is not only a coder who made seminal contributions to the programming language Lisp, but perhaps more notably, he is one of the four founders of Y Combinator. Y Combinator is probably the world most renown start up accelerator. It funded over 4’000 startups that now have combined valuation of 600 Billion USD. Companies that started through it include Airbnb, Codeacademy, Coinbase, Disqus, Dropbox, Reddit, Scribd, Stripe, and Twitch. In this essay, he distils advice on how to get great stuff done. “Take as much risk as you can afford.” Link to the essay 2. Becoming a Magician (autotranslucence.com, 2018) An essay on why going 10x improvements can be much better idea than 2x, at least where you really care. Illustrated on World Bodypainting Competition. Recommended for magicians, body-painters, and anyone who is less cerebral than Paul Graham (which is probably 99% of population). “We don’t necessarily need to make nonlinear jumps in all aspects of our lives, particularly if (according to your values) making such a jump would require a sacrifice you don’t endorse. But for the things you care about most, or are causing you the most suffering, there is probably a nonlinear strategy that you will miss if you pay too close attention to the linear strategy you current have or that people recommend.” Link to the essay 1. In Praise of Idleness (Bertrand Russell, 1932) Bertrand Russell was a British mathematician and philosopher. He made seminal contributions to the field of logic, influencing the development of programming languages and design of computer systems. That it is more than almost anyone would attempt before claiming their right for peaceful retirement, but Bertrand Russel did not stop there, by far. Out of many other achievements, he is also the awardee oof 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature “in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought”. This is what his essay “In Praise of Idleness” is about. “In Praise of Idleness” is a literary gem - skillfully penned, it is an argument to stop glorifying work, and value leisure more. Reading it makes one wonder how did we make so little progress on it since he wrote it (and if he is self-reflecting, as his numerous achievements likely required that he tolled for most of his adult life, putting leisure into background). “Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for the others.” Link to the essay If you find essays an intriguing writing form, I would highly suggest to check out the readsomethingwonderful.com website. It does an amazing job in aggregating lot of great essay writing (but is somewhat computer science centric). Have you read any of these essays? What have you thought about them?

Unluckily, much of the Czech cinematography has not been dubbed in English. But hopefully you should able to find these movies with English subtitles online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are five movies I would recommend to anyone who wants to get better understanding of Czech history, culture and mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pelíšky--cozy-dens-1998&quot;&gt;Pelíšky – Cozy Dens (1998)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Czech festive occasion turned idyllic something would be fishy. In that spirit, Christmas is more likely to be a catastrophe than anything else, as depicted by this dark comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/pelisky.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;movie poster&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167331/&quot;&gt;IMDB link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;s-tebou-mě-baví-svět---i-enjoy-the-world-with-you-1983&quot;&gt;S tebou mě baví svět - I Enjoy the World with You (1983)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three middle aged made go on skiing vacation with their children, leaving their wives at home. This surely can’t go wrong, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/steboumnebavisvet.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;movie poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084620/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk&quot;&gt;IMDB link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;samotáři--loners-2000&quot;&gt;Samotáři – Loners (2000)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did not expect to become lighter and more positive as we go right? It’s Czech movies in the end! Samotáři is a dark comedy about young people, for young people, putting their complicated relationships with friends and partners in the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/samotari.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;movie poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219288/&quot;&gt;IDMB link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;na-samotě-u-lesa---seclusion-near-a-forest-1976&quot;&gt;Na samotě u lesa - Seclusion Near a Forest (1976)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed by Jan Menzel (also known for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090257/?ref_=ttloc_ov&quot;&gt;My Sweet Little Village, 1985&lt;/a&gt;) and written by Jaroslav Smoljak and Zdeněk Svěrák (known for their plays about fictive Czechoslovak multi-talent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1ra_Cimrman&quot;&gt;Jára Cimrman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/nasamoteulesa.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;movie poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074947/?ref_=tt_mv_close&quot;&gt;IMDB link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hoří-má-panenko---the-firemens-ball-1967&quot;&gt;Hoří, má panenko - The Firemen’s Ball (1967)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another comedy, this time not that dark, directed by Miloš Forman. You know it’s gonna be good because Forman is two-time Oscar winner. He received Oscars in 1975 and 1984 (and was nominated in 1996) for his movies One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (starring Jack Nicholson) and Amadeus (a magical drama about life of Mozart), beating nominees like Woody Allen, Frederico Fellini, and Stanley Kubrick. Really, if you did not know Forman yet, go watch some of his movies, they are iconic. Apart from the two above, I suggest The Hair (a musical about hippie counterculture and anti-war movement), Taking Off (featuring a parodical scene of group of posh parents smoking pot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/horimapanenko.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;movie poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061781/&quot;&gt;IMDB link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the movies on the list that were made before 1993 are Czechoslovak (not Czech). With exception of &lt;em&gt;S tebou mě baví svět&lt;/em&gt; which was directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Poled%C5%88%C3%A1kov%C3%A1&quot;&gt;Marie Poledňáková&lt;/a&gt; the other movies were directed by men (sad but not surprising ratio, given that only three (!) women have ever won an Oscar for directing, all after 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

These were more often than not penned by authors living in exile, which does carry the benefit that these authors were often able to contrast the Czech and foreign experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are five books I would recommend to anyone who wants to get better understanding of Czech history, culture and mentality, with one bonus book for those who can read Czech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unbearable-lightness-of-being&quot;&gt;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list would not be complete without Kundera on it. The Unbearable Lightness of being is one of the most widely read books by a Czech author. He penned it after 10 years living in France. The book actually first appeared in French. It follows a turbulent relationship of a romantic couple on the background of events following the Prague Spring of 1968.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/kundera.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;book cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;believe-in-people-the-essential-karel-capek&quot;&gt;Believe in People: The Essential Karel Capek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karel Capek was a writer extraordinaire who penned masterpieces of plays, novels, travel journals, letters and columns. It’s the latter two that the most directly showcase his talent to describe the human condition with his characteristic empathy, understanding and wit. Nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times without receiving one, he is probably my favorite Czech author. You can find some of his essays translated at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/22915&quot;&gt;public depository of the University of Oregon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-poetry-of-jaroslav-seifert&quot;&gt;The Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaroslav Seifert is the only Czechoslovak who ever won a Nobel Prize in Literature “for his poetry which endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man”. A complicated figure in the Czech post-war history, he was a supporter of communism for many years before he started criticizing the party and siding with pro-democracy movements. Nevertheless, his poetry does match up to the Nobel Prize committee judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot; style=&quot;width:45%;min-width:100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/seifert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;book cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good-soldier-svejk&quot;&gt;The Good Soldier Svejk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satire is Czech’s favorite type of humor. This comic book mocking the war and showcasing its futility is one of the Czech classics. Arguable, at nearly 800 pages the book is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long, so you are better of watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049147/&quot;&gt;the movie of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-letters-selected-writings-1965-1990&quot;&gt;Open Letters: Selected Writings, 1965-1990&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaclav Havel is the most prominent political figure of the late 20th century of Czechoslovakia, and one of the most prominent leaders in that period worldwide. His influence spans well beyond the national borders, and he was pivotal in the end of Soviet rule throughout the central and eastern Europe. He received honors and awards from over 25 distinct countries, including the highest civilian award of the United States, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Apart from his political career he has written numerous theater plays and poems. It’s in his letters and essays that his literary and politics personas come the closest together and offer an unique view to the events that lead up to the Velvet Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my point of view, this is the best book to understand the Czech mentality and the events of the 20th century that shaped it. Written as a dialogue between the author, and young woman considering emigration from Czechoslovakia, it will help you understand what were the pivotal events in Czechoslovakian 20th century history and how they shaped the Czech mentality. Unfortunately, as it has not been translated to English, you would have to learn Czech first to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the authors on the list are, at least to some degree, Slovak as well, as they worked in Czechoslovakia. Similarly, it won’t take you a long time to notice: none of the books on the list are by female writers.

She went through her morning routine assuredly and quickly. As usual, she brewed her favorite ginger-mint tea, this time with an extra drop of honey as if it could give her the extra energy, she felt she lacked after a poor night’s sleep. While waiting for the tea to cool down a bit, she quickly typed few supportive messages to her college best friend … her mother has recently gotten quite ill and the friend struggles to cope. Pity they cannot meet up she thought, by now they became geographically too separated. Before brushing her teeth, she put on music in the bathroom, her favorite singer just put out a new album and it’s really good. On her way out she passes by the bedroom to kiss her lover goodbye, and out she goes. No breakfast, that she will have to grab on her way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go well for her at the office. The presentation she was nervous about runs well and she receives positive feedback from her supervisors, so the extra hours she has been putting in apparently have paid off. Some more meetings, a bit of editing work on a report she is finishing, a coffee break with coworkers. On the way home she stops by her favorite yoga studio as a small reward for the day. Finally, home, hungry as she had just a sandwich for lunch. The fridge is quite empty, and by now she is not in the mood for doing groceries, so it will be dinner delivery, maybe tacos? She finishes them while lounging on the sofa, rewatching one of her favorite shows while also texting her mum about the day she had, and looking up tickets for a concert that is coming up in her favorite club next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;busy-ness-has-become-the-default-condition&quot;&gt;Busy-ness has become the default condition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks like an average day, doesn’t it? It even sounds quite nice. In many ways probably akin to your average day. If someone asked Kate, how is she doing, how likely do you think her answer would include the word ‘busy’ in it? Probably quite likely, and not dissimilar to how would you have replied. 
‘How are you’ is a standard question we get, but how about the following ones: Do you think Kate likes being busy? Do you think ‘busyness’ works for her? Do you think she is getting enough rest and in the right form? These are quite simple questions, and the answers to them are not that difficult to guess, but strangely enough, we rarely raise them with our friends, or ourselves for that matter. So, in this post I want to ask them: &lt;strong&gt;Do you like being busy? Are you getting an adequate amount of rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become the semi-default that we stopped questioning. Most of us lead busy lives. Maybe it’s the price we must pay to be financially comfortable? And why not actually? Many of us (including me) like it (maybe bit too much). But the moment you really let the question of whether you like being busy or not sink in, something changes. Because the chances are, you don’t. And even if you do like it, not all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;not-all-rest-is-made-equal&quot;&gt;Not all rest is made equal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most of us will probably be able to say that they are getting some rest during an average week, few will have a sense of whether it is enough or not. I certainly did not, until recently when I was prompted to think about times when I felt really relaxed. The middle-of-vacation falling asleep on a beach type of relaxed. Or when you have done a good yoga session and just sink down to savasana that you don’t want to end. You probably can think of similar experiences when obligations temporarily vanished from your horizon and your body melted as well. So sure, I have memories of feeling super relaxed, but when was the last time I got a chance to feel like it? It must be a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, &lt;strong&gt;most of us are not getting enough rest&lt;/strong&gt;. Partially because we don’t get enough time in our busy lives for it, but &lt;strong&gt;mainly because we are not prioritizing the right type of rest&lt;/strong&gt;. In her recent book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60750102-the-stress-prescription&quot;&gt;The Stress Prescription&lt;/a&gt;, Elissa Epel defines four different mind states as they relate to stress, red mind (acute stress), yellow (baseline cognitive load), green mind (rest), blue mind (deep rest). We spend most of our days in the &lt;strong&gt;yellow zone&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only at work, but also most of the time around it, when our mind is processing obligations, making plans, engaging in socially, or just plain scrolling or browsing on our devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;strong&gt;red zone&lt;/strong&gt; looks down-right undesirable, it actually is a place we should &lt;strong&gt;actively seek out&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s healthy to engage in activities that get you there for a limited period of time, provided they are self-inflicted (HIIT, cold and heat exposure, hyperventilation, …) as these &lt;strong&gt;mount up your general stress resilience&lt;/strong&gt; on a long run. 
&lt;strong&gt;Green mind&lt;/strong&gt; is what we commonly associate with rest. It’s a pleasant state of relaxation when we are fully engaged in leisure activities. It’s a state when you are just being, not being asked to do something. This is facilitated by &lt;strong&gt;observation and engagement in a single task&lt;/strong&gt; (so no multitasking). Think of being in nature or watching a performance. Watching a show on your TV at home would fit here as well, as long as you are fully immersed and don’t have your attention to repeatedly drift to your phone, the fridge, or some responsibilities coming up (which is unlikely - it’s easier to reach this state of mind in a theater or cinema, as your mind associates these places with the single task of observing art). Engaging in sports is an area that is ambiguous. At times you will be in the yellow or even red zones, at brief times in the green one. If you feel you are fully engaged (i.e. in a state of ‘flow’) you are probably in the green zone. It’s also something that has large learned factor to it – if you have been performing this sport or playing this game for some time already, such that you feel some sense of mastery doing it, the time you spend it the green zone will likely be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how about the &lt;strong&gt;blue zone&lt;/strong&gt;? It turns out that one is both &lt;strong&gt;vital for restoration, and barely visited by most during wake time&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a state of rest that occurs when we are in a quiet and safe environment, typically physically secluded, focusing on just one thing (e.g. our breath) or having attention openly drifting. This type of rest occurs during a deep sleep (and that also why it’s important to get enough sleep!) and during mind mind-body practices such as meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-enough-deep-rest-is-vital-for-health-and-wellbeing&quot;&gt;Getting enough deep rest is vital for health and wellbeing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I learnt about this, I tried looking at my daily activities through the red-yellow-green-blue lens and realized that I am by far not prioritizing rest the way I thought I am, or nearly as much. Chances are you will feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you care? Is this anyhow a big deal? Well it kind of is. Researchers have looked at various ways people achieve deep rest (i.e., blue state of mind). In one study, they had people meditate for 20 minutes daily, and meet with a coach weekly. This not only left the people feeling better, but &lt;strong&gt;resulted in positive gene expression changes related to energy metabolism, insulin secretion, telomere maintenance, and inflammation&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062817&quot;&gt;Bhasin et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;). In another study, people were invited to join 6-day long meditation retreat and, again, left not only feeling better but also reporting similar health benefits on the gene expression level. This effect applied even to a control group, that just spent 6-day of free time, without meditation (something the researchers called the ‘vacation effect’), and was further strengthen in those who meditated and were accustomed to the meditation practice (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/tp2016164&quot;&gt;Epel et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;). As it turns out, &lt;strong&gt;restorative rest is a powerful modulator of our health and biology&lt;/strong&gt;. Evidence suggests that &lt;strong&gt;not leaving time and space for it can lead to disease and faster progression of aging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the face of it we do have enough time for leisure, and many would use it to also engage in it, we rarely see it as an opportunity to get deeply immersed in something. In fact, lot of things we would do in our leisure time, such as engaging in sports, catching up with friends, browsing the internet, are just the yellow time creeping in into our green and blue zones. Don’t get me wrong, these are important and fun, but we should not allow them to take up all our leisure time. We &lt;strong&gt;must protect our time and capacity to engage if fully restorative rest&lt;/strong&gt;, to enter, and stay in, the green and blue states of mind. In terms of &lt;strong&gt;return on investment, it may be one of the best things to do for our health and wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
