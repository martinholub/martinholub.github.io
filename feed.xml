&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of novel drugs has been a critical contributor to extending healthspan and fighting diseases, but the process is complex. The involvement of multiple stakeholders and strict regulatory processes are responsible for some of it, but that contribution is dwarfed by our limited understanding of underlying biological processes. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has progressed rapidly showing reasoning ability over large multidimensional datasets. AI, indeed, is transforming the drug discovery process as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we highlight the role of AI in a critical task in the early drug discovery process: target identification. We first introduce the technical background. Next, we review the state-of-the-art using industry examples. Finally, we highlight challenges and directions for future development. Questions we address are: &lt;strong&gt;How is AI currently used in target identification?&lt;/strong&gt; And: &lt;strong&gt;What future developments of AI would position it to make the largest positive impact on this task?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-target-identification&quot;&gt;Understanding Target Identification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drug development is a long and complex process, with average estimates of around 12 years from conceptualization to approval — although post-COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01276-4&quot;&gt;efforts have been made by approval bodies to shorten it&lt;/a&gt; [1]. This is happening through a number of approaches, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fcts.12745&quot;&gt;accelerated approval pathways&lt;/a&gt; [2], leveraging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/10/real-world-data-expedite-drug-approval-process/&quot;&gt;real world data and evidence&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/master-protocols-efficient-clinical-trial-design-strategies-expedite-development-oncology-drugs-and&quot;&gt;changes to clinical trial design&lt;/a&gt; [3]. Lead discovery is the first step, including target identification &amp;amp; screening for compounds or biologics against the target, followed by optimization of lead compound and preclinical testing. If the lead compound manages to get through these hoops, it can finally go into clinical trials, where success can pave the way for approval and the title “drug”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target identification is an inherent part of academic and industry research. Traditionally, it describes the process of identifying proteins and their roles in specific disease conditions through different experimental methods (Fig.1). A common pipeline is discovering and knocking out the gene coding for the protein of interest and studying the effects on a disease model. Recently, a number of different target types have emerged. Coding and regulatory nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA, different metabolites, and even whole cell types (in the context of cell therapy) all represent potential targets for a drug candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of methods like &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mmbr.67.4.657-685.2003&quot;&gt;RNA interference&lt;/a&gt; [4] (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinholub.com/2024/10/16/RNAi.html&quot;&gt;my post on RNAi&lt;/a&gt;), or more recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0496&quot;&gt;CRISPR-based tools&lt;/a&gt; [5], large-scale screens for experimental target identification have become common in well-resourced labs. Using these methods, a range of genes in disease-model cell lines can be knocked out. Subsequent phenotypic and/or genotypic assaying allows the identification of new possible drug target candidates (Fig.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;Fig.1: Overview of target identification approaches. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2023.06.010&quot;&gt;Adapted from Pun et al., 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experimental approaches widen our horizons by characterizing proteins whose functions were not previously known. Most commonly, this knowledge ends up accessible on the internet — through publications — and can be leveraged. Considerable efforts have been made to develop and maintain massive databases containing information on genes, their corresponding proteins, and their function. All of this plays a crucial role in the usage of sequencing technologies, which involve using these databases at some point in their downstream analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, with the increased abundance of genomic data, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have gained a lot of traction. Using GWAS, the genetic makeup of patients suffering from certain ailments can be compared to healthy individuals to identify targets specific to disease pathologies. Similarly, the availability of other omics datasets (transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, etc.) (Fig.1) in the public domain has exponentially increased due to advancements in technologies and lower costs of the corresponding experiments. Consequently, while requiring bioinformatics expertise, leveraging publicly and commercially available multiomics datasets &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; has become a go-to strategy for identifying promising targets before testing them in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-ai-in-target-identification&quot;&gt;Understanding AI in Target Identification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the plethora of data and the rapid advances in computer hardware, today there is no domain of biomedical research where AI doesn’t contribute – from information retrieval to clinical diagnoses, and from data processing &amp;amp; integration to protein modeling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/about&quot;&gt;AlphaFold&lt;/a&gt;). AI is an umbrella term that has been used to denote traditional mathematical models such as regression, to abstract phenomena like artificial general intelligence (AGI). The use cases of AI discussed in this article are in between these two extremes. In the following text, we briefly introduce AI as it is being used in target discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence, or AI, refers to a computer’s ability to perform tasks that are characteristic of intelligent beings. What these algorithms attempt to do is &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; trends from swathes of data, and apply what they &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt; to new, unseen data. For example, an accurate skin cancer detection model has to be fed thousands of images of skin cancer and benign tumors, so that it can &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; to discriminate between the two. Similarly, large language models (LLMs) like &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/claude&quot;&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; are trained on books, articles, and pretty much every text available on the internet in the public domain, which makes them robust in answering a broad range of questions. On the other hand, specialist models like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BioMedBERT/biomedbert&quot;&gt;BioMedBERT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/about&quot;&gt;Perplexity AI&lt;/a&gt;, are geared towards scientific conversations and provide resources and citations.  All these models are examples of deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a vast subfield of AI that makes use of neural networks. Neurons form the fundamental unit of these networks and are similar to biological neurons: receiving multiple signals from surrounding neurons, processing them in a certain way, and having a single output that is then sent to another neuron. Using multiple layers of such neurons leads to neural networks that come in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/&quot;&gt;shapes and sizes&lt;/a&gt; and varying complexities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deep learning models’ ability to learn &amp;amp; generalize makes them extremely versatile in biomedical research. Companies discussed below are using different variations of deep learning to integrate publicly available and self-generated multi-omics datasets along with other types of data like microscopy images, text from biomedical literature, and patient data to capture intricacies and trends that are difficult to detect manually. By training such models biomarkers, perturbation effects, and novel targets can be predicted &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; and subsequently validated through experimentation. Hence, biomedical data in every available form is being leveraged with complex, computation-heavy, and often proprietary AI architectures for identifying new targets against diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;case-studies-and-real-world-examples&quot;&gt;Case Studies and Real-world Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment of writing, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2023.06.010&quot;&gt;over 20 assets&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials where AI was leveraged for target identification, as well as along the downstream drug development process [6]. A number of them are already in phase II, and many more are in the Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recursion.com/&quot;&gt;Recursion Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; is a pioneer in data-driven, platform-first biotech (known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cantos-ventures/what-is-techbio-ef01cd61834d&quot;&gt;TechBio&lt;/a&gt;). Since its founding in 2013, the company built up the capacity to run over 2 million experiments every week and collected over 22 PB (that’s 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) of data. Their pipeline generates lead candidates by applying reverse-genetic causal machine learning models on patient-specific sequencing data and integrating it with health records, databases on small molecule compounds, their target interaction predictions, and data from scientific publications. To facilitate this workflow, the company developed LOWE (Large Language Model-Orchestrated Workflow Engine) that allows users to interface with the pipeline with natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead molecules are screened in imaging-based and sc-RNA sequencing workflows, generating genome-wide perturbation datasets that are fed into deep learning models.  Recursion differentiates itself from its competition by being an early and bullish adopter of image-based data collection (phenomics). While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rxrx.ai/rxrx3#about&quot;&gt;a fraction of the generated dataset has been made public&lt;/a&gt; [7], much of it remains proprietary to Recursion. Their phenomics foundation model (trained on the publicly available data) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recursion.com/news/nothing-short-of-phenomenal-new-deep-learning-model-available-on-nvidias-bionemo-platform&quot;&gt;Phenome-Beta&lt;/a&gt; was released on NVIDIA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/&quot;&gt;BioNeMo platform&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Recursion’s most advanced model, Phenome-1 remains proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recursion currently has &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?spons=Recursion%20Pharmaceuticals%20Inc.&quot;&gt;five small molecule drugs in phase II trials&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-initiates-two-additional-clinical-trials-total-four&quot;&gt;REC-4881&lt;/a&gt; is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAP2K1&quot;&gt;MAP2K1&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAP2K2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; being developed to reduce polyp burden and cancer progression in people living with FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). FAP is an inherited disease that leads to formation of polyps in the rectum and colon, eventually manifesting in colorectal cancer (CRC). &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-announces-completion-phase-1-study-rec-3964&quot;&gt;REC-3964&lt;/a&gt; is a non-antibiotic small molecule inhibitor of C.difficile toxins which is being developed for the potential treatment of gastrointestinal infection. It finished phase I in 2023, and started enrollment for phase II in October 2024. Most recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT06678659&quot;&gt;REC-1245&lt;/a&gt; entered phase I/II clinical trials for advanced metastatic tumors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insilico.com/&quot;&gt;InSilico Medicine&lt;/a&gt; is another early adopter of AI in small molecule drug discovery and design. The company leverages its end-to-end integrated Pharma.AI platform consisting of three components to drive its drug discovery and development: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01619&quot;&gt;PandaOmics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01191&quot;&gt;Chemistry42&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpt.3008&quot;&gt;inClinico&lt;/a&gt; [8-10]. PandaOmics is an AI target identification engine that combines a diverse range of omics data totalling over 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; data points across disease-specific and healthy tissue datasets. The platform further integrates text-based analysis on clinical trials, grants and publications, all together allowing for identification of novel targets that meet a large need. “Our target discovery philosophy is to find an optimal balance between commercial tractability, novelty, and confidence,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/insilico-ai-cancer-treatment-ism9274/?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Drug_Discovery_and_Development__TrendMD_0&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Alex Zhavoronkov, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine for Drug Discovery &amp;amp; Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company currently has one asset in a phase II trial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?spons=InSilico%20Medicine%20Hong%20Kong%20Limited&quot;&gt;four more in phase I&lt;/a&gt;, and one preclinical asset. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02143-0&quot;&gt;INS018_055&lt;/a&gt; is an orally available small molecule TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) inhibitor with therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis currently in phase II trials [11]. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230912041846/en/Exelixis-and-Insilico-Medicine-Enter-into-Exclusive-Global-License-Agreement-for-ISM3091-a-Potentially-Best-in-Class-USP1-Inhibitor&quot;&gt;ISM3091/XL309&lt;/a&gt; is a small molecule inhibitor of USP1, an enzyme implicated in DNA damage repair and relevant in the context of some forms of ovarian, prostate, and breast cancers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/insilico-medicines-latest-ai-engineered-drug-ism5411-could-provide-a-novel-approach-for-treating-ibd/&quot;&gt;ISM5411&lt;/a&gt; is an oral prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this investigational drug is supposed to regulate levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1a), which should in turn control gut inflammation. Finally, the firm has a CDK12/13 inhibitor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/insilico-ai-cancer-treatment-ism9274/?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Drug_Discovery_and_Development__TrendMD_0&quot;&gt;ISM9274&lt;/a&gt;, in the preclinical pipeline that shows promise against multiple cancers, particularly triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While others focus purely on target-identification (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://biorelate.com/company&quot;&gt;Biorelate&lt;/a&gt;), most companies integrate AI-driven target identification into a full drug development pipeline (further examples include  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.valohealth.com/&quot;&gt;Valo Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://relaytx.com/&quot;&gt;Relay Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exscientia.ai/pipeline&quot;&gt;Exscientia&lt;/a&gt; (recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.exscientia.ai/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Recursion-and-Exscientia-Enter-Definitive-Agreement-to-Create-a-Global-Technology-Enabled-Drug-Discovery-Leader-with-End-to-End-Capabilities/default.aspx&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Recursion), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimbustx.com/&quot;&gt;Nimbus Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benevolent.com/pipeline/&quot;&gt;Benevolent A&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opentargets.org/&quot;&gt;Open Targets&lt;/a&gt; stands out as a notable example of open and collaborative science, bringing multiple industry stakeholders together to share disease and target annotation data in easily accessible format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-outlook-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Future Outlook and Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When applying AI to target discovery, a number of challenges emerge. First, any model is only as good as the data it has been trained on. Failing to collect data in areas of unmet needs or for underserved patient populations is at large risk of leading to biased models that exacerbate health inequality. Second, AI models have only limited transparency, and to an extent function as black boxes. Managing their regulatory compliance and data integrity requires teams to adapt to changing frameworks. Third, training AI models requires substantial computational resources. This presents challenges to equity of access, where well-resourced companies may benefit from preferential access to compute hardware. Finally, a culture of keeping these models, and the data they have been trained on, proprietary is likely to create silos of knowledge and hinder progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, AI has clearly taken a firm hold across the drug development pipeline, including target identification. The increased volume and modality of datasets, together with more computational power and advances in AI architectures, are increasing the rate at which new candidates are discovered and enter clinical trials. In the future, there is a hope that AI will substantially increase the success rate of these trials as well as be helpful in aiding the development of drugs for previously intractable targets. Examples in this article have focused on protein targets and small-molecule drugs. It is likely that AI-driven models optimized for discovery of different targets than proteins will emerge in the near future. Similarly, other modalities than small molecules are poised to gain more prominence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01524-x&quot;&gt;Peptide-based therapeutics&lt;/a&gt; [12], for example, have seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://drughunter.com/articles/mk-0616-the-2023-molecule-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;a number of successes&lt;/a&gt; in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of AI in drug discovery is bright. If you want to learn more about how AI is revolutionizing biotech and stay up to date, be sure to check &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/aixbiotech_nucleate&quot;&gt;Nucleate’s AI in Biotech&lt;/a&gt; initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction Development of novel drugs has been a critical contributor to extending healthspan and fighting diseases, but the process is complex. The involvement of multiple stakeholders and strict regulatory processes are responsible for some of it, but that contribution is dwarfed by our limited understanding of underlying biological processes. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has progressed rapidly showing reasoning ability over large multidimensional datasets. AI, indeed, is transforming the drug discovery process as well. In this article, we highlight the role of AI in a critical task in the early drug discovery process: target identification. We first introduce the technical background. Next, we review the state-of-the-art using industry examples. Finally, we highlight challenges and directions for future development. Questions we address are: How is AI currently used in target identification? And: What future developments of AI would position it to make the largest positive impact on this task? Understanding Target Identification Drug development is a long and complex process, with average estimates of around 12 years from conceptualization to approval — although post-COVID-19, efforts have been made by approval bodies to shorten it [1]. This is happening through a number of approaches, including accelerated approval pathways [2], leveraging real world data and evidence as well as changes to clinical trial design [3]. Lead discovery is the first step, including target identification &amp;amp; screening for compounds or biologics against the target, followed by optimization of lead compound and preclinical testing. If the lead compound manages to get through these hoops, it can finally go into clinical trials, where success can pave the way for approval and the title “drug”. Target identification is an inherent part of academic and industry research. Traditionally, it describes the process of identifying proteins and their roles in specific disease conditions through different experimental methods (Fig.1). A common pipeline is discovering and knocking out the gene coding for the protein of interest and studying the effects on a disease model. Recently, a number of different target types have emerged. Coding and regulatory nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA, different metabolites, and even whole cell types (in the context of cell therapy) all represent potential targets for a drug candidate. With the arrival of methods like RNA interference [4] (see also my post on RNAi), or more recently CRISPR-based tools [5], large-scale screens for experimental target identification have become common in well-resourced labs. Using these methods, a range of genes in disease-model cell lines can be knocked out. Subsequent phenotypic and/or genotypic assaying allows the identification of new possible drug target candidates (Fig.1). Fig.1: Overview of target identification approaches. Adapted from Pun et al., 2023. These experimental approaches widen our horizons by characterizing proteins whose functions were not previously known. Most commonly, this knowledge ends up accessible on the internet — through publications — and can be leveraged. Considerable efforts have been made to develop and maintain massive databases containing information on genes, their corresponding proteins, and their function. All of this plays a crucial role in the usage of sequencing technologies, which involve using these databases at some point in their downstream analysis. In the last decade, with the increased abundance of genomic data, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have gained a lot of traction. Using GWAS, the genetic makeup of patients suffering from certain ailments can be compared to healthy individuals to identify targets specific to disease pathologies. Similarly, the availability of other omics datasets (transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, etc.) (Fig.1) in the public domain has exponentially increased due to advancements in technologies and lower costs of the corresponding experiments. Consequently, while requiring bioinformatics expertise, leveraging publicly and commercially available multiomics datasets in silico has become a go-to strategy for identifying promising targets before testing them in the lab. Understanding AI in Target Identification With the plethora of data and the rapid advances in computer hardware, today there is no domain of biomedical research where AI doesn’t contribute – from information retrieval to clinical diagnoses, and from data processing &amp;amp; integration to protein modeling (AlphaFold). AI is an umbrella term that has been used to denote traditional mathematical models such as regression, to abstract phenomena like artificial general intelligence (AGI). The use cases of AI discussed in this article are in between these two extremes. In the following text, we briefly introduce AI as it is being used in target discovery. Artificial intelligence, or AI, refers to a computer’s ability to perform tasks that are characteristic of intelligent beings. What these algorithms attempt to do is learn trends from swathes of data, and apply what they learned to new, unseen data. For example, an accurate skin cancer detection model has to be fed thousands of images of skin cancer and benign tumors, so that it can learn to discriminate between the two. Similarly, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude are trained on books, articles, and pretty much every text available on the internet in the public domain, which makes them robust in answering a broad range of questions. On the other hand, specialist models like BioMedBERT or Perplexity AI, are geared towards scientific conversations and provide resources and citations. All these models are examples of deep learning. Deep learning is a vast subfield of AI that makes use of neural networks. Neurons form the fundamental unit of these networks and are similar to biological neurons: receiving multiple signals from surrounding neurons, processing them in a certain way, and having a single output that is then sent to another neuron. Using multiple layers of such neurons leads to neural networks that come in all shapes and sizes and varying complexities. The deep learning models’ ability to learn &amp;amp; generalize makes them extremely versatile in biomedical research. Companies discussed below are using different variations of deep learning to integrate publicly available and self-generated multi-omics datasets along with other types of data like microscopy images, text from biomedical literature, and patient data to capture intricacies and trends that are difficult to detect manually. By training such models biomarkers, perturbation effects, and novel targets can be predicted in silico and subsequently validated through experimentation. Hence, biomedical data in every available form is being leveraged with complex, computation-heavy, and often proprietary AI architectures for identifying new targets against diseases. Case Studies and Real-world Examples At the moment of writing, there are over 20 assets in clinical trials where AI was leveraged for target identification, as well as along the downstream drug development process [6]. A number of them are already in phase II, and many more are in the Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling phase. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a pioneer in data-driven, platform-first biotech (known as TechBio). Since its founding in 2013, the company built up the capacity to run over 2 million experiments every week and collected over 22 PB (that’s 1015) of data. Their pipeline generates lead candidates by applying reverse-genetic causal machine learning models on patient-specific sequencing data and integrating it with health records, databases on small molecule compounds, their target interaction predictions, and data from scientific publications. To facilitate this workflow, the company developed LOWE (Large Language Model-Orchestrated Workflow Engine) that allows users to interface with the pipeline with natural language. The lead molecules are screened in imaging-based and sc-RNA sequencing workflows, generating genome-wide perturbation datasets that are fed into deep learning models. Recursion differentiates itself from its competition by being an early and bullish adopter of image-based data collection (phenomics). While a fraction of the generated dataset has been made public [7], much of it remains proprietary to Recursion. Their phenomics foundation model (trained on the publicly available data) Phenome-Beta was released on NVIDIA’s BioNeMo platform earlier this year. Recursion’s most advanced model, Phenome-1 remains proprietary. Fig.2: Overview of ‘phenomics’ for high-throughput screening. Top panel: Cell images are collected at different perturbations (middle) and across multiple color channels (right). Adapted from Recursion’s 2023 annual report. Bottom panel: Multi-channel images are the training data for a deep learning model that learns their experimentally relevant features. The model can be used for future inference. Adapted from rxrx.ai. Recursion currently has five small molecule drugs in phase II trials. REC-4881 is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MAP2K1/2 being developed to reduce polyp burden and cancer progression in people living with FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). FAP is an inherited disease that leads to formation of polyps in the rectum and colon, eventually manifesting in colorectal cancer (CRC). REC-3964 is a non-antibiotic small molecule inhibitor of C.difficile toxins which is being developed for the potential treatment of gastrointestinal infection. It finished phase I in 2023, and started enrollment for phase II in October 2024. Most recently REC-1245 entered phase I/II clinical trials for advanced metastatic tumors InSilico Medicine is another early adopter of AI in small molecule drug discovery and design. The company leverages its end-to-end integrated Pharma.AI platform consisting of three components to drive its drug discovery and development: PandaOmics, Chemistry42 and inClinico [8-10]. PandaOmics is an AI target identification engine that combines a diverse range of omics data totalling over 1012 data points across disease-specific and healthy tissue datasets. The platform further integrates text-based analysis on clinical trials, grants and publications, all together allowing for identification of novel targets that meet a large need. “Our target discovery philosophy is to find an optimal balance between commercial tractability, novelty, and confidence,” said Alex Zhavoronkov, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine for Drug Discovery &amp;amp; Development. The company currently has one asset in a phase II trial, four more in phase I, and one preclinical asset. INS018_055 is an orally available small molecule TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) inhibitor with therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis currently in phase II trials [11]. ISM3091/XL309 is a small molecule inhibitor of USP1, an enzyme implicated in DNA damage repair and relevant in the context of some forms of ovarian, prostate, and breast cancers, ISM5411 is an oral prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this investigational drug is supposed to regulate levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1a), which should in turn control gut inflammation. Finally, the firm has a CDK12/13 inhibitor, ISM9274, in the preclinical pipeline that shows promise against multiple cancers, particularly triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. While others focus purely on target-identification (e.g. Biorelate), most companies integrate AI-driven target identification into a full drug development pipeline (further examples include Valo Health, Relay Therapeutics, Exscientia (recently acquired by Recursion), Nimbus Therapeutics, and Benevolent A. Finally, Open Targets stands out as a notable example of open and collaborative science, bringing multiple industry stakeholders together to share disease and target annotation data in easily accessible format. Future Outlook and Challenges When applying AI to target discovery, a number of challenges emerge. First, any model is only as good as the data it has been trained on. Failing to collect data in areas of unmet needs or for underserved patient populations is at large risk of leading to biased models that exacerbate health inequality. Second, AI models have only limited transparency, and to an extent function as black boxes. Managing their regulatory compliance and data integrity requires teams to adapt to changing frameworks. Third, training AI models requires substantial computational resources. This presents challenges to equity of access, where well-resourced companies may benefit from preferential access to compute hardware. Finally, a culture of keeping these models, and the data they have been trained on, proprietary is likely to create silos of knowledge and hinder progress. Despite these challenges, AI has clearly taken a firm hold across the drug development pipeline, including target identification. The increased volume and modality of datasets, together with more computational power and advances in AI architectures, are increasing the rate at which new candidates are discovered and enter clinical trials. In the future, there is a hope that AI will substantially increase the success rate of these trials as well as be helpful in aiding the development of drugs for previously intractable targets. Examples in this article have focused on protein targets and small-molecule drugs. It is likely that AI-driven models optimized for discovery of different targets than proteins will emerge in the near future. Similarly, other modalities than small molecules are poised to gain more prominence. Peptide-based therapeutics [12], for example, have seen a number of successes in the last year. The future of AI in drug discovery is bright. If you want to learn more about how AI is revolutionizing biotech and stay up to date, be sure to check Nucleate’s AI in Biotech initiative.

Events that took place after this date are not reflected.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I provide a brief field recap on RNA interference as therapeutic modality. First, I provide background on its biological mechanisms. Next, I follow up with an overview of the siRNA therapeutics field, highlighting approved drugs, as well major ongoing trials. I conclude with a short recap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanism-of-rna-interference&quot;&gt;Mechanism of RNA Interference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which RNA molecules suppress gene expression in sequence specific fashion. The process was initially described in late 80’s and early 90’s, [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(84)90050-3&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.113.2.503&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], and elucidated at the turn of the century with work that yielded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/35888&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. RNAi is a natural process of gene regulation that has physiological role in wide range of organisms, including mammals and plants. Despite some important differences, the process is mostly conserved among species. In the following, we describe it in broad strokes, focusing on its mechanism in eukaryotic and human cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RNAi, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) enters cells where it is recognized by the Dicer enzyme. Dicer contains two RNAse III domains. When recruited to dsRNA, two Dicer enzymes work in tandem to cleave the molecule at a regular interval of ~22 nucleotides. The cleavage generates 2 nucleotide overhangs at the 3’ end. The 5’ end, left unprotected, is rapidly phosphorylated. The resulting RNA molecule is the &lt;strong&gt;small interfering RNA (siRNA)&lt;/strong&gt;, which sets off silencing. Notably, exogenously administered siRNAs are also capable of triggering silencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The siRNA molecule prompts the assembly of an effector nuclease complex &lt;strong&gt;RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)&lt;/strong&gt;, whereby the RISC complex binds the siRNA and unwinds it. The sense strand, also called passenger strand, is digested by Ago2, a member of the complex and of the Argonaut protein family. The antisense strand, also called guide strand, guides RISC complex towards a complementary mRNA sequence. Upon recognition, the mRNA sequence is cleaved and digested, effectively leading to silencing of corresponding gene. Once the RISC complex is activated, it is capable of targeting numerous mRNA transcript copies, producing an effect that is sustained over several weeks in non-dividing cells [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2742&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description we gave given so far is accurate, but omits some details that are relevant to applications. &lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, the mRNA cleavage and digestion is only one mechanism by which siRNA produces silencing. Chromatin modification and remodeling, as well translational inhibition, have been shown to play a role, albeit to smaller extent. &lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, siRNA is capable of silencing sequences other than its perfect complements. This can happen in two ways: a) by extension of the silencing signal in the 3’ -&amp;gt; 5’ direction, effectively leading to silencing of sequences left to the target, and b) by RISC’s tolerance to mismatches, particularly at the ends of the guide sequence [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2022.02.004&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. &lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, mammalian somatic cells exhibit nonspecific response to delivery of dsRNA, and so does the innate immune system react to it by raising interferon levels. This precludes dsRNA use from silencing applications [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb0200_70&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. Fortunately, the direct delivery of siRNAs is generally well tolerated. &lt;strong&gt;Fourth&lt;/strong&gt;, studies in simpler organisms demonstrated the spreading of silencing signal into cell types beyond the target [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1068836&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. The extent to which this plays a role in human cells is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aspects-of-therapeutic-sirna-design&quot;&gt;Aspects of Therapeutic siRNA Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only ~22 nucleotides (practically between 19 and 25), siRNA is a relatively simple molecule. The intense work over the past two decades demonstrated that this is by no way a limitation to sophistication of designs and modifications that it can lend itself to. In the following we describe several of the most widely adopted design features, including &lt;strong&gt;formulation&lt;/strong&gt;, chemical &lt;strong&gt;modification&lt;/strong&gt; of individual bases, and &lt;strong&gt;conjugation&lt;/strong&gt; to additional moieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest examples of siRNA’s were minimally modified, and their formulation was as much as subcutaneous injection of a solution in physiological buffer. Motivated by the need to prevent siRNAs from degradation, and to target their delivery to specific tissues, in the 2000’s the field explored different formulation methods. These included polymer nanoparticles and liposomes (or lipid nanoparticles, LNPs) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3765&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. The latter, LNPs, become part of the first siRNA therapy, approved by both the FDA and the EMA in 2018 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-019-0591-y&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right formulation for LNPs was, however, a substantial undertaking [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-019-0591-y&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. Consequently, the field shifted away from encapsulation formulations. Instead, the focus turned to chemically modifying siRNAs, and conjugating them to moieties that garner tissue specificity. Variants of this approach are dominant among all the approved therapies, as well as siRNA drug candidates currently in clinical trials. We illustrate this at detail on the example of givosiran [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1807838&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- All modifications featured on this molecule are also present on both clinical assets of Silence Therapeutics \[[ref](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190119676A1)\]. 
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Givosiran is a siRNA therapeutic agent for reducing levels of expression of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1). Givosiran is approved in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, with authorizations issued at the end of 2019 by the FDA, and two months later by the EMA. It is marketed under the brand name Givlaari by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Givosiran is a fully chemically modified siRNA (Fig.1). Apart from featuring the canonical two nucleotide 3’ overhang and 5’ phosphate, it includes a number of modifications. All RNA bases are modified at the 2’ position of a ribose: either with &lt;strong&gt;2’-Fluoro (2’-F)&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;2’-O-Methyl (2’-OMe)&lt;/strong&gt;. Both modifications improve target binding affinity [&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3765&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. The 2’-OMe modification has been further shown to foster nuclease resistance, and reduce immune stimulation [&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3765&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. 5’ end is modified with &lt;strong&gt;E-vinyl phosphonate (5’-E-VP)&lt;/strong&gt;. 5’-E-VP is a phosphatase resistant 5’-phosphate analog, improving tissue accumulation by increasing chemical stability [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx507&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. Number of phosphodiester bonds at the end of each strand have been replaced by phosphorothioate, increasing the molecule’s stability, as well as facilitating its trafficking and uptake [&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3765&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. Finally the 3’ end of the sense strand is conjugated to a trivalent GalNAc (Fig. 2). &lt;strong&gt;GalNAc, N-Acetyl galactosamine&lt;/strong&gt;, is an amino-derivative of galactose and the ligand for asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), and abundant transmembrane protein in hepatocytes. The moiety is responsible for guiding the siRNA molecule to these cells, which are targets of the therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the position and type of the modifications have effect on number of therapeutically relevant parameters including toxicity, target binding and tissue accumulation. Despite large body of research available to date, and because number of modifications other than described are possible [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0207-x&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], the discovery of siRNA molecules for therapeutic applications continues to be heavily empirical. The best performing molecules must be found by extensive candidate screening. Due to difficulty of translating in-vitro to in-vivo results, this happens largely in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, so far we have discussed only one type of targeting moiety, GalNAc. Clearly, the utility of siRNA therapeutics is not limited to hepatocytes. However, targeting other cell types requires careful choice and optimization of the 3’ sense-strand conjugate, as well as its linker. Number of extrahepatic targeting ligands have been demonstrated so far. These include lipids [&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/3/1082/5245439&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], peptides [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c12043&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], centyrins [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.02.015&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], antibodies [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2Fgkaa286&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], aptamers [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2017.12.015&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;], as well as branched siRNA arrangements [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0205-0&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. Finally, recent advances in mRNA-based therapeutics, commonly encapsulated as LNPs, have spurred new wave of interest in liposomes, particularly in advanced formulations with newly synthesized lipids [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01867-3&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;siRNA has become a popular therapeutic modality, and is pursued for number of targets across tens of indications by sizeable number of companies. As of Q12024, there were 6 FDA approved siRNA drugs (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an exciting time for both developers of RNAi therapeutics as well as patients that stand to benefit from them, with number of recently approved drugs and several potential blockbusters queuing up in the pipeline. However, two aspects darken this otherwise rosy picture. &lt;strong&gt;I)&lt;/strong&gt; Cardiovascular disease is by far the largest pursued indication, but, at the moment of writing, there are at least five late stage clinical assets going after it! This is great news for patients, but bad news for developers, who will see the blockbuster potential of their drugs dwindle. &lt;strong&gt;II)&lt;/strong&gt; There is a very apparent lack of diversity of targeting strategies, with majority of the (investigational) drugs leveraging GalNAc conjugation for delivery to hepatocytes. Some target eye or skin. Only three clinical trials for lungs and kidneys have reached phase II, as did one trial for the brain [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-023-00998-y&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. The sustained success of RNAi therapeutics will be conditioned on RNAi companies’ ability to devise strategies for extrahepatic delivery, with muscle and brain representing particularly attractive, but also elusive, targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading everyone! Did you enjou this recap? And what area would you like to see covered next? Let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="biotech" /><category term="science" /><summary type="html">This field recap was writen at end of Q22024. Events that took place after this date are not reflected. In this post, I provide a brief field recap on RNA interference as therapeutic modality. First, I provide background on its biological mechanisms. Next, I follow up with an overview of the siRNA therapeutics field, highlighting approved drugs, as well major ongoing trials. I conclude with a short recap. Mechanism of RNA Interference RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which RNA molecules suppress gene expression in sequence specific fashion. The process was initially described in late 80’s and early 90’s, [ref, ref], and elucidated at the turn of the century with work that yielded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine [ref]. RNAi is a natural process of gene regulation that has physiological role in wide range of organisms, including mammals and plants. Despite some important differences, the process is mostly conserved among species. In the following, we describe it in broad strokes, focusing on its mechanism in eukaryotic and human cells. In RNAi, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) enters cells where it is recognized by the Dicer enzyme. Dicer contains two RNAse III domains. When recruited to dsRNA, two Dicer enzymes work in tandem to cleave the molecule at a regular interval of ~22 nucleotides. The cleavage generates 2 nucleotide overhangs at the 3’ end. The 5’ end, left unprotected, is rapidly phosphorylated. The resulting RNA molecule is the small interfering RNA (siRNA), which sets off silencing. Notably, exogenously administered siRNAs are also capable of triggering silencing. The siRNA molecule prompts the assembly of an effector nuclease complex RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), whereby the RISC complex binds the siRNA and unwinds it. The sense strand, also called passenger strand, is digested by Ago2, a member of the complex and of the Argonaut protein family. The antisense strand, also called guide strand, guides RISC complex towards a complementary mRNA sequence. Upon recognition, the mRNA sequence is cleaved and digested, effectively leading to silencing of corresponding gene. Once the RISC complex is activated, it is capable of targeting numerous mRNA transcript copies, producing an effect that is sustained over several weeks in non-dividing cells [ref]. The description we gave given so far is accurate, but omits some details that are relevant to applications. First, the mRNA cleavage and digestion is only one mechanism by which siRNA produces silencing. Chromatin modification and remodeling, as well translational inhibition, have been shown to play a role, albeit to smaller extent. Second, siRNA is capable of silencing sequences other than its perfect complements. This can happen in two ways: a) by extension of the silencing signal in the 3’ -&amp;gt; 5’ direction, effectively leading to silencing of sequences left to the target, and b) by RISC’s tolerance to mismatches, particularly at the ends of the guide sequence [ref]. Third, mammalian somatic cells exhibit nonspecific response to delivery of dsRNA, and so does the innate immune system react to it by raising interferon levels. This precludes dsRNA use from silencing applications [ref]. Fortunately, the direct delivery of siRNAs is generally well tolerated. Fourth, studies in simpler organisms demonstrated the spreading of silencing signal into cell types beyond the target [ref]. The extent to which this plays a role in human cells is not fully understood. Aspects of Therapeutic siRNA Design With only ~22 nucleotides (practically between 19 and 25), siRNA is a relatively simple molecule. The intense work over the past two decades demonstrated that this is by no way a limitation to sophistication of designs and modifications that it can lend itself to. In the following we describe several of the most widely adopted design features, including formulation, chemical modification of individual bases, and conjugation to additional moieties. The earliest examples of siRNA’s were minimally modified, and their formulation was as much as subcutaneous injection of a solution in physiological buffer. Motivated by the need to prevent siRNAs from degradation, and to target their delivery to specific tissues, in the 2000’s the field explored different formulation methods. These included polymer nanoparticles and liposomes (or lipid nanoparticles, LNPs) [ref]. The latter, LNPs, become part of the first siRNA therapy, approved by both the FDA and the EMA in 2018 [ref]. Finding the right formulation for LNPs was, however, a substantial undertaking [ref]. Consequently, the field shifted away from encapsulation formulations. Instead, the focus turned to chemically modifying siRNAs, and conjugating them to moieties that garner tissue specificity. Variants of this approach are dominant among all the approved therapies, as well as siRNA drug candidates currently in clinical trials. We illustrate this at detail on the example of givosiran [ref]. Givosiran is a siRNA therapeutic agent for reducing levels of expression of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1). Givosiran is approved in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, with authorizations issued at the end of 2019 by the FDA, and two months later by the EMA. It is marketed under the brand name Givlaari by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Givosiran is a fully chemically modified siRNA (Fig.1). Apart from featuring the canonical two nucleotide 3’ overhang and 5’ phosphate, it includes a number of modifications. All RNA bases are modified at the 2’ position of a ribose: either with 2’-Fluoro (2’-F), or 2’-O-Methyl (2’-OMe). Both modifications improve target binding affinity [ref]. The 2’-OMe modification has been further shown to foster nuclease resistance, and reduce immune stimulation [ref]. 5’ end is modified with E-vinyl phosphonate (5’-E-VP). 5’-E-VP is a phosphatase resistant 5’-phosphate analog, improving tissue accumulation by increasing chemical stability [ref]. Number of phosphodiester bonds at the end of each strand have been replaced by phosphorothioate, increasing the molecule’s stability, as well as facilitating its trafficking and uptake [ref]. Finally the 3’ end of the sense strand is conjugated to a trivalent GalNAc (Fig. 2). GalNAc, N-Acetyl galactosamine, is an amino-derivative of galactose and the ligand for asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), and abundant transmembrane protein in hepatocytes. The moiety is responsible for guiding the siRNA molecule to these cells, which are targets of the therapeutic. Figure 1: Schematic depiction of the molecular composition of Givosiran. AS – antisense, S – sense strands. See text for detailed description. Figure 2: The molecular structure of the (GalNAc)3 conjugate shown in Fig. 1. Both the position and type of the modifications have effect on number of therapeutically relevant parameters including toxicity, target binding and tissue accumulation. Despite large body of research available to date, and because number of modifications other than described are possible [ref], the discovery of siRNA molecules for therapeutic applications continues to be heavily empirical. The best performing molecules must be found by extensive candidate screening. Due to difficulty of translating in-vitro to in-vivo results, this happens largely in animal models. Similarly, so far we have discussed only one type of targeting moiety, GalNAc. Clearly, the utility of siRNA therapeutics is not limited to hepatocytes. However, targeting other cell types requires careful choice and optimization of the 3’ sense-strand conjugate, as well as its linker. Number of extrahepatic targeting ligands have been demonstrated so far. These include lipids [ref], peptides [ref], centyrins [ref], antibodies [ref], aptamers [ref], as well as branched siRNA arrangements [ref]. Finally, recent advances in mRNA-based therapeutics, commonly encapsulated as LNPs, have spurred new wave of interest in liposomes, particularly in advanced formulations with newly synthesized lipids [ref].

I had high expectations, but the event did not disappoint and managed to meet them. Never have I ever been to an event where networking with a diverse group of prospective founders, investors and industry professionals was so seamless. I can’t wait to see the innovation and collaboration that these connections will spark and want to send out a huge thank you to the fellow members of Nucleate leadership, speakers and sponsors &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was packed with panel discussions, interviews, pitches and fireside chats. Below I summarize my favorite insights across five key areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Career Planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Company Culture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partnerships and Dealmaking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leadership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Startup Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ask-for-mentoring-in-career-transitions&quot;&gt;Ask for mentoring in career transitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiating mentorship relationships can be anxiety-provoking, certainly if you are already more on the introverted side. But, judging from experiences within my network, it is very clear that those who do ask for mentorship achieve far better career outcomes. Career transitions are a natural way to go out and approach people who are in positions and industries you hope to break into. It also gives you a clear ask: “Would you be available to meet me for 30 minutes to share advice that could help me transition to the X industry, and land the Y or Z roles?” setting a clear agenda for your meeting and increasing chances for positive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-networking-first-connect-on-a-human-level&quot;&gt;When networking, first connect on a human level&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People you would like to reach out to (including mentors) have one thing in common – their agendas are packed. Of course, you are reaching out to them for a reason – they are successful and recognized in their fields. A good intention, respecting their time, can make you feel pressured to make your ask as quickly as possible. Surprisingly, this tends to be counterproductive. Be succinct, but don’t do this at the expense of sharing where you are coming from, and highlighting why you are reaching to them. You don’t have to know everything, and being vulnerable about your unknowns will likely strengthen the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-shy-away-from-short-term-opportunities-or-non-conventional-career-moves&quot;&gt;Don’t shy away from short-term opportunities or non-conventional career moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem that great careers must be carefully forethought and emerge only from a sequence of upward steps. Some certainly do, but many don’t. As you are thinking about your next career move, don’t over-index on security. If there is a short-term opportunity (ballpark 6-12 months) that you are excited about, don’t discard it, even if it seems risky or is in an area different from your existing expertise. It is likely to open doors to opportunities you could not access otherwise, and will help you build unique career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-culture-from-the-day-one&quot;&gt;Build culture from the day one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building culture is not easy, but it is way easier than changing it. Prioritize the culture you want to build from the get go. Hire slow, and, if necessary, fire fast. To increase diversity, make sure that you have a diverse hiring panel, and look beyond the CV. Not all jobs require a degree and you are better off hiring for attitude and training for aptitude than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;every-day-is-an-opportunity-to-demonstrate-good-culture&quot;&gt;Every day is an opportunity to demonstrate good culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building company culture does not stop with hiring great employees. To prevent it from deteriorating by neglect in the messiness of ups and downs of your business, find ways to demonstrate it every day. Social media can be good for that, but think also about your relationships with suppliers, and your daily interactions with employees. Treat these as everyday opportunities to reinforce the culture you want to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;praise-in-public-give-feedback-in-private&quot;&gt;Praise in public, give feedback in private&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a helpful reminder and the title says it all. Feedback is the breakfast of champions, and if you care about the satisfaction and development of your team, you absolutely should give both, positive as well as critical feedback. However, save the latter for one-on-one interactions, where there is space for more context and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a founder, you are inherently in a risky environment and will not be able to predict the outcome of many actions you take. Sometimes the results will be great, and sometimes less so. When you encounter these uncertainties it is helpful to know that the people whom you have entered into agreements with have your best interest in mind. Pick partners and investors who will be your champions in thick and thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-transparent-about-risks-and-unknowns&quot;&gt;Be transparent about risks and unknowns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When courting partners and investors, you may be tempted to show only the best case scenario, or to discount the size of risk and uncertainties you are inevitably facing. Doing so will hurt you, if not now, certainly later. Be transparent about risks, and use interactions with partners to polish your de-risking strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-building-new-relationships-as-well-as-managing-the-old-ones&quot;&gt;Keep building new relationships, as well as managing the old ones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have secured a partner or investor, you should pat yourself on the back, and then get back to work. Good relationships require good communication and it is your responsibility to keep stakeholders engaged and informed. Additionally, no matter how good, no partner is granted to stick with you forever. Especially corporate VCs, while generally very friendly and helpful with feedback, may walk away easily if their strategy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, you are likely to have the IQ you need to be successful. But to become a good leader, you will have to lean more into your ‘softer’ side and work on developing your emotional intelligence. Proving you are right serves little purpose aside from ego inflation if it alienates others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;craft-steel-strong-narratives-and-build-teams-around-it&quot;&gt;Craft steel-strong narratives and build teams around it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a leader, your most important goal is to articulate a bullet-proof narrative you whole-heartedly believe in, in a form that is easily digestible and motivates others. If you don’t have that, you cannot lead effectively and have to go back to the (proverbial) whiteboard. Only once you have it, should you go ahead to building rockstar teams and communities, and rising funds to do so. The most groundbreaking narratives are at the very end of what seems technically plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific founders will often see startups as an opportunity to continue pursuing their favorite research project. While understandable, this should not be the case. The technological innovation should have happened prior to founding, and work ahead should be primarily focused on turning this innovation into a successful commercial opportunity. This involves identifying go-to-market strategy, and establishing partnerships necessary to effectively pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gets measured gets managed. You should always be on the lookout for what you can measure in your startup. Many of the things you decide to measure will be product, field or company specific, but some are generalizable. Measure your &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; (how quickly you reach milestones), and &lt;em&gt;capital efficiency&lt;/em&gt; (how much it costs you) as soon as possible. Investors care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-and-when-not-to-bootstrap&quot;&gt;When, and when not, to bootstrap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping refers to building your business while not taking in dilutive funding. Whether to bootstrap or not is a choice that requires evaluation of the market and your personal fit. Bootstrapping is appealing because it allows founders to keep a high stake in their companies and offers unique opportunities for independence and agency. One advantage of bootstrapping is that it is likely to make you very capital efficient. To be able to bootstrap, you should have carried market analysis and identified a clear customer profile for your product. If you are bootstrapping, you should also incentivize your employees with a profit sharing scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases in biotech, bootstrapping will not be the optimal choice. You should not bootstrap if you are in a competitive environment where other firms have a lot of cash on hand, or if bootstrapping would require you to pursue assets that will distract you from your core mission. Bootstrapping can lead to lower valuations, as the valuation will be tied to sales of your non-core assets, and not a potential of your crown-jewel. Additionally, bootstrapping can make you spending-averse, which can delay the time you decide to outsource, or purchase the right tools, and negatively impact productivity (i.e. your speed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-simple-blueprint-for-building-in-biotech&quot;&gt;A simple blueprint for building in biotech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All plans will be reductionist, but some may be helpful. Here is one that seems about right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate IP (most commonly in academia)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify killer experiments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get funding to do the experiments (preferably non-dilutive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do the experiments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If results are positive, raise more money, otherwise restart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, plan back from milestones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Series B: Efficacy in the clinic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Series A: Identification of development candidates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seed: Figure out your pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I had high expectations, but the event did not disappoint and managed to meet them. Never have I ever been to an event where networking with a diverse group of prospective founders, investors and industry professionals was so seamless. I can’t wait to see the innovation and collaboration that these connections will spark and want to send out a huge thank you to the fellow members of Nucleate leadership, speakers and sponsors &amp;lt;3. The event was packed with panel discussions, interviews, pitches and fireside chats. Below I summarize my favorite insights across five key areas: Career Planning Company Culture Partnerships and Dealmaking Leadership Startup Strategy Let’s dive right in. Insights on Career Planning Ask for mentoring in career transitions Initiating mentorship relationships can be anxiety-provoking, certainly if you are already more on the introverted side. But, judging from experiences within my network, it is very clear that those who do ask for mentorship achieve far better career outcomes. Career transitions are a natural way to go out and approach people who are in positions and industries you hope to break into. It also gives you a clear ask: “Would you be available to meet me for 30 minutes to share advice that could help me transition to the X industry, and land the Y or Z roles?” setting a clear agenda for your meeting and increasing chances for positive response. Credits: @Christalyn Rhoades and @Michelle Briggs When networking, first connect on a human level People you would like to reach out to (including mentors) have one thing in common – their agendas are packed. Of course, you are reaching out to them for a reason – they are successful and recognized in their fields. A good intention, respecting their time, can make you feel pressured to make your ask as quickly as possible. Surprisingly, this tends to be counterproductive. Be succinct, but don’t do this at the expense of sharing where you are coming from, and highlighting why you are reaching to them. You don’t have to know everything, and being vulnerable about your unknowns will likely strengthen the relationship. Credits: @Madelyn Heart Don’t shy away from short-term opportunities or non-conventional career moves It may seem that great careers must be carefully forethought and emerge only from a sequence of upward steps. Some certainly do, but many don’t. As you are thinking about your next career move, don’t over-index on security. If there is a short-term opportunity (ballpark 6-12 months) that you are excited about, don’t discard it, even if it seems risky or is in an area different from your existing expertise. It is likely to open doors to opportunities you could not access otherwise, and will help you build unique career capital. Credits: @Alex Titus Insights on Company Culture Build culture from the day one Building culture is not easy, but it is way easier than changing it. Prioritize the culture you want to build from the get go. Hire slow, and, if necessary, fire fast. To increase diversity, make sure that you have a diverse hiring panel, and look beyond the CV. Not all jobs require a degree and you are better off hiring for attitude and training for aptitude than the other way around. Credits: @Arun Skaria, @Cameron Pye and @Madelyn Heart Every day is an opportunity to demonstrate good culture Building company culture does not stop with hiring great employees. To prevent it from deteriorating by neglect in the messiness of ups and downs of your business, find ways to demonstrate it every day. Social media can be good for that, but think also about your relationships with suppliers, and your daily interactions with employees. Treat these as everyday opportunities to reinforce the culture you want to build. Credits: @Jon Chee, @Arun Skaria Praise in public, give feedback in private This is a helpful reminder and the title says it all. Feedback is the breakfast of champions, and if you care about the satisfaction and development of your team, you absolutely should give both, positive as well as critical feedback. However, save the latter for one-on-one interactions, where there is space for more context and discussion. Credits: @Jon Chee Insights on Partnerships and Dealmaking Partner and make deals only with people whom you really trust As a founder, you are inherently in a risky environment and will not be able to predict the outcome of many actions you take. Sometimes the results will be great, and sometimes less so. When you encounter these uncertainties it is helpful to know that the people whom you have entered into agreements with have your best interest in mind. Pick partners and investors who will be your champions in thick and thin. Credits: @Marie Noe and @Josh Felts Be transparent about risks and unknowns When courting partners and investors, you may be tempted to show only the best case scenario, or to discount the size of risk and uncertainties you are inevitably facing. Doing so will hurt you, if not now, certainly later. Be transparent about risks, and use interactions with partners to polish your de-risking strategy. Credits: @Nicholas Hertz and @Christalyn Rhoades Keep building new relationships, as well as managing the old ones Once you have secured a partner or investor, you should pat yourself on the back, and then get back to work. Good relationships require good communication and it is your responsibility to keep stakeholders engaged and informed. Additionally, no matter how good, no partner is granted to stick with you forever. Especially corporate VCs, while generally very friendly and helpful with feedback, may walk away easily if their strategy changes. Credits: @Deepa Talpade and @Nicholas Hertz Insights on Leadership Embrace emotional intelligence As a scientist, you are likely to have the IQ you need to be successful. But to become a good leader, you will have to lean more into your ‘softer’ side and work on developing your emotional intelligence. Proving you are right serves little purpose aside from ego inflation if it alienates others. Credits: @Jon Chee, @Arun Skaria Craft steel-strong narratives and build teams around it As a leader, your most important goal is to articulate a bullet-proof narrative you whole-heartedly believe in, in a form that is easily digestible and motivates others. If you don’t have that, you cannot lead effectively and have to go back to the (proverbial) whiteboard. Only once you have it, should you go ahead to building rockstar teams and communities, and rising funds to do so. The most groundbreaking narratives are at the very end of what seems technically plausible. Credits: @Rick Klausner Insights on Startup Strategy Startup should be 20% innovation, and 80% strategy Scientific founders will often see startups as an opportunity to continue pursuing their favorite research project. While understandable, this should not be the case. The technological innovation should have happened prior to founding, and work ahead should be primarily focused on turning this innovation into a successful commercial opportunity. This involves identifying go-to-market strategy, and establishing partnerships necessary to effectively pursue it. Credits: @Mariola Szenk and @Sofia Guerra Measure speed and capital efficiency What gets measured gets managed. You should always be on the lookout for what you can measure in your startup. Many of the things you decide to measure will be product, field or company specific, but some are generalizable. Measure your speed (how quickly you reach milestones), and capital efficiency (how much it costs you) as soon as possible. Investors care.

&lt;p&gt;The Keynes vs. Hayek debate centers on contrasting economic theories about how to manage economies, especially during downturns. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes&quot;&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/a&gt; advocated for active government intervention, suggesting that during recessions, increased government spending can boost demand and pull economies out of downturns. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek&quot;&gt;Friedrich Hayek&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, argued that such interventions distort market signals and lead to inefficiencies, believing that free markets and minimal government interference lead to better economic outcomes by allowing natural corrections through the price mechanism. Essentially, Keynes emphasized short-term government action to stabilize the economy, while Hayek stressed long-term market processes and individual liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;economics-everyday-role&quot;&gt;Economics’ Everyday Role&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you like it or not, economics is a force that influences the decisions we make and the opportunities we are dealt with. From stagnation to growth, from inequality to prosperity, from housing scarcity to tight job market, all these are issues that are intimately tied with economics. Ignoring this is at one’s peril. For the longest time it seems like nothing is going wrong, until suddenly you are in for an unpleasant surprise.
Unfortunately, the way economics is taught tends to be dull, if not downright unpalatable. Trying to catch up on the education by following politics is bound to leave you more confused then you started. Yet, grasping some key concepts in economics is important to reaching personal goals as it is to being a more conscious citizen. If I have painted a pessimistic picture, don’t despair, here comes a plot twist: a rap battle on one of the most pertinent topics in macroeconomics – how much control should the government interfere with the free market?&lt;/p&gt;

It was an afternoon packed with inspiring talks, great discussions, and new connections. The program included four parallel breakout sessions. I picked one named “The Basics of Biotech Board Management.” The session was organized as a panel, with three cool biotech executives with range of experience with being board memebrs: Eline van Beest (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hybridizetherapeutics.com/&quot;&gt;Hybrize Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;), Felice Verdyun (Partner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eqtgroup.com/private-capital/life-sciences/&quot;&gt;EQT Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;), and Mirjam Mol-Arts (pharma executive previously at companies including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.organon.com/&quot;&gt;Organon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ferring.com/&quot;&gt;Ferring Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;). I chose this session, as I reasoned that it will be where I learn the most in the shortest amount of time. Good bet, the only time I stopped taking notes was when I raised my hand to ask questions! Below is a summary of these notes. Anyone who is biotech and interested in what makes a good board and how to manage it should find this insightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway-1-as-in-the-kitchen-so-in-the-boardroom-stick-to-a-handful-of-high-quality-ingredients&quot;&gt;Takeaway #1: As in the kitchen, so in the boardroom: stick to a handful of high-quality ingredients.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In smaller companies you may have quite a lot of flexibility on who is on a board. In larger and especially listed companies you will have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20221118IPR55706/parliament-approves-landmark-rules-to-boost-gender-equality-on-corporate-boards&quot;&gt;a number of rules and regulations that you have to follow&lt;/a&gt;. But irrespective, one rule holds as much in the kitchen as it does in the boardroom: to make a great dish, start with great ingredients. And yes, you can also overpower a great dish by mixing too many flavors at once. Here is what this means for boards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think hard about whom you offer a board seat to. Board should have only as many people as it needs, and not more.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you can offer a scientific advisory seat instead, do it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best time to start a board is BEFORE you raise an investment. It allows you to keep investors off the board.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investors are the ultimate split-personalities on any board. They are in constant conflict of interest between representing their LPs (i.e. cashing quickly and at the highest multiple possible), and building a sustainable business (something that the CEO wants and that creates more value in the long-term).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To further reduce conflicts of interest, prefer independent board members. As much as you can, try to have more than half of the board seats independent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before you become a part of any board meeting, make sure to follow some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/search?query=corporate%20governance&quot;&gt;courses on corporate governance&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, help members of your boards to do so as well!
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can also include governance-related training as part of the pre-board meeting sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/harrypotterhat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;An ideal investor should always be able to identify if they are representing the interests of their LPs or the ones of the company, as these will not always be aligned. In practice this is nearly as difficult as it was for the Sorting Hat to decide if Harry belongs to Slytherin or Gryffindor.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway-2-it-is-not-talking-behind-closed-doors-if-everyone-does-it-right&quot;&gt;Takeaway #2: It is not talking behind closed doors if everyone does it, right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boards of directors may seem serious. They will certainly appear somewhat abstract to anyone who has not been part of one. Throught this breakout session, I was reminded that boards are made of board members, and these are, drumroll … people! People, who are &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; normal, that is. Consequently, managing a board will be, more than anything else, managing people. To do so, you will end up talking with them often, including outside of an actual board meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will spend (&lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;) time for preparation, including talking with board members one-on-one (more on that later).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board meetings will often be preceded by a pre-meeting. This may include more scientific, technical, or open ended discussions. Only these will likely last longer than the board meeting itself!
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;These are great opportunities to make sure everyone on the board has the necessary technical, operational, or other background needed for effective management.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board meetings will be commonly followed by an executive session.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_session&quot;&gt;Executive sessions&lt;/a&gt; are confidential, and give the board the chance to address any internal friction and reflect on its operation. Frequently, the CEO will be absent from this session, or its part, offering the board a chance to reflect on their performance (i.e. trash-talk them).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Culture will impact where and how board-matters are addressed. The Dutch have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1080/08911762.2017.1296985&quot;&gt;low-context culture&lt;/a&gt;, which means that they mean what they say, and address each other directly. On the other hand, Britts are generally much more soft spoken, and wrap their statements in politeness formulas, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@k.kozmana/the-dualist-world-view-of-an-immigrant-b3e7a4d00f75&quot;&gt;“Did you have a chance to…?”, “Would you mind if I… ?”, and “We should be mindful about…”.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Soft-spoken cultures tend to have more talking happen out of a board room.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, irrespective of cultural differences, board dinner will probably be the occasion where most matters are discussed. Don’t leave it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway-3-do-as-a-good-scout-would-be-prepared&quot;&gt;Takeaway #3: Do as a good scout would: be prepared!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably should not have come as a surprise. As in nearly everywhere in life: if you want to do well, make sure you also prepare well. What did surprise me a bit though, was what is the amount of preparation that will be helfpul. The answer? A lot. Here is how to do it and not go crazy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send out quarterly report sufficiently ahead of the meeting
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Keep updates in meetings short and snappy. This has the added advantage of leaving everyone energized.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedule a dedicated preparatory meeting with every board member ahead of time.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The goal of this meeting is to understand points of view, opinions, concerns, and eventual fears. The meeting is there to resolve and address these &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; the actual board meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s fair to have disagreements and contrarian opinions. But you want them to be known, with a strategy on how to address them, before the board meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most important person you want to give a clear briefing on the agenda and points in it to is the meeting chairman. They are the person with the most agency over how smoothly the meeting will run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever adequate and possible, include a presentation and potential Q&amp;amp;A with the company team during a board meeting. This requires some forethought, but will be appreciated by both the board and the team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, do not neglect to send good summaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;one&quot; src=&quot;/img/alwaysprepared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/01/11&quot;&gt;From Calvin &amp;amp; Hobbs, January 11, 1986.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot of the advice here is common sense. It is particularly because of this that I found it useful to hear. For anybody entering their first board, you will walk in assuming others probably know how things should be done, and try not to stick out too much or ask too many questions. What I am taking from this session is that if something does not seem right, it may as well not be. Boards are, after all, made of people, and people make mistakes and can sometimes be lazy. So yes, you by all means should have high standards. You can also ask about things you don’t understand. Now, you know that the best time to do this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in the board meeting, but in the number of interactions and meetings around it.&lt;/p&gt;

It was an afternoon packed with inspiring talks, great discussions, and new connections. The program included four parallel breakout sessions. I picked one named “The Basics of Biotech Board Management.” The session was organized as a panel, with three cool biotech executives with range of experience with being board memebrs: Eline van Beest (CEO of Hybrize Therapeutics), Felice Verdyun (Partner at EQT Life Sciences), and Mirjam Mol-Arts (pharma executive previously at companies including Organon and Ferring Pharmaceuticals). I chose this session, as I reasoned that it will be where I learn the most in the shortest amount of time. Good bet, the only time I stopped taking notes was when I raised my hand to ask questions! Below is a summary of these notes. Anyone who is biotech and interested in what makes a good board and how to manage it should find this insightful. Takeaway #1: As in the kitchen, so in the boardroom: stick to a handful of high-quality ingredients. In smaller companies you may have quite a lot of flexibility on who is on a board. In larger and especially listed companies you will have a number of rules and regulations that you have to follow. But irrespective, one rule holds as much in the kitchen as it does in the boardroom: to make a great dish, start with great ingredients. And yes, you can also overpower a great dish by mixing too many flavors at once. Here is what this means for boards: Think hard about whom you offer a board seat to. Board should have only as many people as it needs, and not more. If you can offer a scientific advisory seat instead, do it. The best time to start a board is BEFORE you raise an investment. It allows you to keep investors off the board. Investors are the ultimate split-personalities on any board. They are in constant conflict of interest between representing their LPs (i.e. cashing quickly and at the highest multiple possible), and building a sustainable business (something that the CEO wants and that creates more value in the long-term). To further reduce conflicts of interest, prefer independent board members. As much as you can, try to have more than half of the board seats independent. Before you become a part of any board meeting, make sure to follow some courses on corporate governance. Similarly, help members of your boards to do so as well! You can also include governance-related training as part of the pre-board meeting sessions. An ideal investor should always be able to identify if they are representing the interests of their LPs or the ones of the company, as these will not always be aligned. In practice this is nearly as difficult as it was for the Sorting Hat to decide if Harry belongs to Slytherin or Gryffindor. Takeaway #2: It is not talking behind closed doors if everyone does it, right? Boards of directors may seem serious. They will certainly appear somewhat abstract to anyone who has not been part of one. Throught this breakout session, I was reminded that boards are made of board members, and these are, drumroll … people! People, who are mostly normal, that is. Consequently, managing a board will be, more than anything else, managing people. To do so, you will end up talking with them often, including outside of an actual board meeting: You will spend (a lot) time for preparation, including talking with board members one-on-one (more on that later). Board meetings will often be preceded by a pre-meeting. This may include more scientific, technical, or open ended discussions. Only these will likely last longer than the board meeting itself! These are great opportunities to make sure everyone on the board has the necessary technical, operational, or other background needed for effective management. Board meetings will be commonly followed by an executive session. Executive sessions are confidential, and give the board the chance to address any internal friction and reflect on its operation. Frequently, the CEO will be absent from this session, or its part, offering the board a chance to reflect on their performance (i.e. trash-talk them). Culture will impact where and how board-matters are addressed. The Dutch have a low-context culture, which means that they mean what they say, and address each other directly. On the other hand, Britts are generally much more soft spoken, and wrap their statements in politeness formulas, such as “Did you have a chance to…?”, “Would you mind if I… ?”, and “We should be mindful about…”. Soft-spoken cultures tend to have more talking happen out of a board room. Finally, irrespective of cultural differences, board dinner will probably be the occasion where most matters are discussed. Don’t leave it out! Takeaway #3: Do as a good scout would: be prepared! This probably should not have come as a surprise. As in nearly everywhere in life: if you want to do well, make sure you also prepare well. What did surprise me a bit though, was what is the amount of preparation that will be helfpul. The answer? A lot. Here is how to do it and not go crazy: Send out quarterly report sufficiently ahead of the meeting Keep updates in meetings short and snappy. This has the added advantage of leaving everyone energized. Schedule a dedicated preparatory meeting with every board member ahead of time. The goal of this meeting is to understand points of view, opinions, concerns, and eventual fears. The meeting is there to resolve and address these before the actual board meeting. It’s fair to have disagreements and contrarian opinions. But you want them to be known, with a strategy on how to address them, before the board meeting. The most important person you want to give a clear briefing on the agenda and points in it to is the meeting chairman. They are the person with the most agency over how smoothly the meeting will run. Whenever adequate and possible, include a presentation and potential Q&amp;amp;A with the company team during a board meeting. This requires some forethought, but will be appreciated by both the board and the team. Finally, do not neglect to send good summaries. From Calvin &amp;amp; Hobbs, January 11, 1986. Lot of the advice here is common sense. It is particularly because of this that I found it useful to hear. For anybody entering their first board, you will walk in assuming others probably know how things should be done, and try not to stick out too much or ask too many questions. What I am taking from this session is that if something does not seem right, it may as well not be. Boards are, after all, made of people, and people make mistakes and can sometimes be lazy. So yes, you by all means should have high standards. You can also ask about things you don’t understand. Now, you know that the best time to do this is not in the board meeting, but in the number of interactions and meetings around it. Thanks for reading everyone!

The discussion was moderated (and transcribed!) by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamlake6/&quot;&gt;William Lake&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;WL&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;panel-overview&quot;&gt;Panel Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Panelists will compare the Dutch and American entrepreneurship cultures and discuss the differences, as well as challenges and opportunities this leads to. The panel also creates an opportunity to discuss if startup founders should think about going global from early on, and the mindset shifts this may require. The learning goal for this panel is to understand how Nucleate’s mission can translate at a national level, and how the ecosystem can best benefit from it. The panelists will highlight opportunities and programs that facilitate the mobility of biotech and entrepreneurial talents, companies and investment opportunities between the Netherlands and abroad. The panel will feature four panelists, including members from a Dutch globally diversified biotech VC firm, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency and Health~Holland, as well as an early-stage entrepreneur with experience with the US bio-entreprenurial ecosystem. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-takeaways&quot;&gt;Top Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Netherlands is a good place to start a deeptech company thanks to a business friendly infrastructure, number of early-stage funding opportunities and a deep talent pool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Netherlands is, however, a small market and companies must look for growth opportunities abroad from the get go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While there is less capital than in the US, it gets you further. This keeps the environment attractive for VCs who gain the opportunity to earn higher multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mindset shifts to empower Dutch and European bio-entrepreneurs:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1) Failing = Learning, 2) Give-back mentality, 3) Don’t be afraid to ask!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-remarks&quot;&gt;Additional Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Netherlands has excellent clinical trial infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dutch and European biotechs tend to be patient-centric, including patients from the early on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-transcript&quot;&gt;Discussion Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; I’d like to invite our next round of panelists down. And while they’re getting down here, thank you all for coming and especially thank you to our panelists. So today’s panel will be focusing on what some of the strengths are of the Dutch local biotech ecosystem, but then also what we can learn from other global biotech ecosystems. So Boston, San Francisco, we have a strong Nucleate presence there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we get started, I’d like to introduce our panelists. So from left to right here, we have Cinzia Silvestri. Cinzia is the CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gobiond.com/&quot;&gt;Bi/ond&lt;/a&gt;. She is a Termeer fellow, which she can tell us a little bit about later in the presentation, and holds a PhD in microelectronics from TU Delft. And Bi/ond is a tech bio company that uses microelectronics to develop a human-like system for disease state development. Next we have Keno Gutierrez. He’s a general partner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://biogenerationventures.com/en/&quot;&gt;BioGeneration Ventures&lt;/a&gt;. And as part of his role at BGV, the CEO and founder of Brandaris Therapeutics. Prior to BGV, he worked at M Ventures, where he was responsible for pharma and life science investment. And he has a PhD in genetics from UCL London and an MBA from Insead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have Kianti Figler, who is the CEO and co-founder of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/upstream-foods/&quot;&gt;Upstream Foods&lt;/a&gt;. Upstream Foods is a new cultivated seafood company that is using fat cells to create sustainable and healthy cultured seafood products. And lastly, we have Jeroen Krüter, who comes to us from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://investinholland.com/&quot;&gt;Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency&lt;/a&gt;. This is part of Invest in Holland, which tries to get international companies to establish a footprint here in the Netherlands. As part of his time at the NFIA, he also worked with the New York City office in the States. So today we will be focusing on, as I mentioned, what we can learn from some of the other global biotech ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel2_carrousel.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; And so to start us off, I’d like to ask Kianti about your experience starting a company here in the Netherlands. What are some of the strengths of the local Dutch biotech ecosystem? And are you already thinking about scaling abroad with respect to talent, operations and finance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KF:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’ll start off by saying thank you for having us. So just to give a little bit of context, I can only speak to my own experience here, but we started from zero. So we’re not a spin out. We didn’t take any IP with us from anywhere. We were a team with an idea, kind of crazy and we figured let’s give it a go. I think for us the early stages here in the Netherlands were great. There’s some small brands that you can apply for and for us that’s what really got us started that little pre-seed funding. Then that next phase, that little bit of a bigger jump in funding was harder for us as a deep tech company. You’re too early for a  lot of venture capital. You’re too
risky for a lot of the regional development agencies. And we actually went to to Denmark,
to the Bioinnovation Institute to apply for funding there. That’s what really allowed us to rent our lab, hire first people and kick it off and get to a point where we are interesting enough for venture capital. I think that the Netherlands is great in terms of talent. There’s really top notch talent here that is excited to work for startups, very mission driven and oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I mean that has been our journey. I think there’s a lot of value here in terms of talent, grants to support you along the way, mentors who are willing to help out and share their experience. I’d say that’s been my experience so far. As a cultivated seafood company, we would have to apply for novel foods regulation, which means that per definition, the Netherlands, and Europe is kind of a tough market for us to launch in, which means that we are looking to the US to not only scale, but even launch our first product, which is a challenge, but also an opportunity I think. And I think we’re already here in the Netherlands, so let’s move our product activities to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; And Cinzia, how does that compare and contrast with your experience starting
Bi/ond?Are you also feeling some of these regulatory pressures? I know that your
company has, for example, lots of partnerships with European hospitals to create these clinically relevant disease states. So are you also thinking about expanding your operations abroad at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CS:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, let’s say right now we have around 15 customers between academic hospitals and pharma in Europe and the UK. But of course, like I think every start-up should think from the beginning that they are at least European, if not global start-ups. So the Netherlands is really a nice place to start some product concepts, really get a foot into the ecosystem because there are so many excellence in the academic sector as well as pharmas. But then if you want to be successful, you have to look abroad. So then basically that’s what we are doing right now. By the end of the year, we plan to work the first three customers in the US and this month it will be the biggest big pharma that we have right now that is in the Boston area. So basically it’s like
really planning for starting to get a foot at least depending on let’s say the kind of background that your startup has, but an example in our case is going to be Boston is the place to be. And basically like really starting to develop your network there also with other peers, it really has to be in your strategic plan from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; And Keno, we’ve already touched a little bit on funding. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the difference in the VC field between the US and here in the Netherlands. How easy is it for, you know, young companies to find funding here in the Netherlands? And then also maybe some differences in investment strategies that you might find between the US based and the EU VC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KG:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Good afternoon everyone. Happy to be here. Well so, to come here. I was working from home, took my bike to the train station, took a train, rented another bike and came here. Super easy. And that’s a good analogy for how the infrastructure in the Netherlands is set up. There’s a lot of support for business. There’s very friendly environment for business, very easy to set up a new company. There’s a very good rule of law in terms of corporate law which makes new financings very easy to to come together because it’s very friendly for new investors to to come. There’s an educated workforce, it’s a very deep talent pool, so it’s very easy to recruit people and it’s very well connected. So it’s very easy to put together syndicates from around Europe and the US. So it’s very similar in terms of corporate governance and corporate law compared to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a lot of similarities and at the moment there’s what people call an arbitrage, so difference in what one can get for the same amount of capital here versus in the US particularly in areas like Boston or San Francisco. So that is a key difference because investing here locally we can push things further with the same amount of capital. So there’s some interesting similarities, there’s some differences in general bringing people on board, it’s easy. So as long as there’s good science. I’ll give you a couple of examples. So I work for BGV. We were the founders of a company called Acerta Pharma which got in like &lt;inaudible&gt; and eventually got sold to AstraZeneca for $7 billion. And now we started here in the way we brought in investors from the US, high caliber and, there&apos;s multiple examples, you know, the portfolio will be getting started and then bring US investors and so forth.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel2_002.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; And then Jeroen, so a lot of your work involves bringing either foreign, US or otherwise companies here to the Netherlands to set up operations. So what are some of the strengths the local Dutch biotech ecosystem has that these companies that are looking to relocate
are looking to leverage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JK:&lt;/strong&gt; I think a lot has already been said by these people and I love that their companies are kind of also ambassadors for life science and health ecosystem. Over the last couple of
years, a couple of organizations from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Economic Affairs really figured like, OK, how do we sell the Netherlands to abroad? And we came up with the sentence “Europe’s connected life science and health metropolis”. It’s a bit long, but it will stick at one point. And what does that connectedness say? That can kind of be divided in three things. So first of all, logistics, that’s what the Netherlands is known for. It’s DHL #1 for already like 15 years. So it’s the roads, but it’s definitely also the air for pharma transports Schiphol, but also Maastricht are both pharma gateways for all of Europe. But it’s also digital. We have the fastest fiber internet in Europe here in the Netherlands because we have the Internet Exchange. So we’re already quite good at AI. But now with the merger with life sciences, you see a lot of digital health companies popping up in the  Netherlands and choosing the Netherlands for their expansions. The second one is collaboration. That’s already set by the other panelists. So it’s really that collaborative ecosystem working together. How can we create together even more value than we do by ourselves? And the last one is of course talent, very highly educated, English speaking, innovative talent like you guys are. And that’s really a value for the Netherlands and that’s what foreign companies see as an added value and why they would like to move to the Netherlands as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. And then kind of flipping that question on its head, what we do to keep companies here, talent here, for example, Kianti illustrated that maybe she will set up ooperations in the US because of the regulatory environment. Is there stuff that the local ecosystem can do to continue to make it more appealing to keep your operations here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JK:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that’s more on the practical side. We need more power and electricity. That’s a bit of an issue now. But for the rest, it’s really trying to continue on that collaborative ecosystem. But also organizations like yours, like Nucleate, making that bridge with America. So it’s actually that physical bridge, having that here showcasing what we can do. And how we even can become better at what we already do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. So we’ve touched on kind the local beginnings of a company, right? Like what starting a company is like here in the Netherlands. Most of the most exciting life science companies today are trying to solve global problems as Cinzia mentioned as well. You know, whether that’s agri-tech feeding a world that is increasingly affected by climate change, drug development for an increasing aging population. So for this next topic, and we’ve started to touch on this a little bit already, but I’d like to dive into some of the more cultural and intangible factors perhaps at play here in the Netherlands versus in the US. So Cinzia, you are a Termeer fellow, so first, could you tell us a little bit about what the Termeer Fellowship is? And in your experience as part of being a Termeer Fellow, what are some of the cultural differences that you’ve noticed between, say, US founders or US startup teams and EU founders and EU startup teams?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CS:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. So let’s say a Termeer Fellow is part of our Termeer Foundation that is built up on the legacy of Henri Termeer. Henri Termeer, he was a great entrepreneur that was the CEO of Genzyme. He was the third biggest biotech company back in his days and basically he was sold to Sanofi and he was one of the first in the rare genetic disease space, and rare genetic is really hard business in the pharma sector. And what Henri was always doing is that he was mentoring a lot of first time CEOs and he created basically most of the CEOs that are right now in the Boston area. Unfortunately he passed away and his wife created a foundation based on his legacy to basically help people like me, first time CEOs, to connect with these great mentors that already have been there multiple times, so in all the ups and downs of the startups field. And basically as Henri was Dutch, I got the opportunity to have a special scholarship that is called Transatlantic Connection. That basically every year is given to a Dutch entrepreneur to connect to the Boston area. And that’s actually in one year time I had the opportunity to really learn a lot first hand about what is the Boston ecosystem, who are the major player because they have the opportunity to talk to these mentors, but also networking and knowing your peers and you will definitely see a bit of difference there and I will touch upon two main aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is the fear of failure. Every first-time CEO is afraid to fail. The one that did it multiple times, they really don’t care. They really take it as a proud moment because when they fail they learn a lot. But definitely like here is seen a bit more as a stigma and sometimes it stop us even from taking action. So don’t be afraid if you think you have a good idea, it is never the right time, just try and worst case you’re going to fail, but you have to learn a lot and that’s what I’m also trying to digest sometimes. And the second thing is the give back mentality. There is a great ecosystem there and the people that have done this journey before, they are always open to give you feedback. And to help you out, also sponsoring you, some of them are going to be your Angel investors or they’re going to be your advisor. An important thing that we have to learn is to ask. If you don’t ask, you don’t, you don’t get anything out of it. So it’s really important for us or everybody to keep on asking people if they can connect you with someone and for them, for people in the US probably it’s easier and also give back mentality when you’re getting somewhere. Remember what you all through the way and do the same with the new generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel2_003.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. And Kianti, do you have some of the same experiences? So starting a new company, as you said, you were a couple people basically with an idea. What was your process like finding mentorship and people who can help you kind of start actually getting this company off the ground?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KF:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I can definitely relate to the first time CEO experience of being afraid to fail. I had to really shut that off in my brain, like, OK, that is a given that might happen, accept it, move on from it and and try anyways. I think for us, we were part of the Start Life Incubation Program at Wageningen, which really opened the door for us to an ecosystem, to an entrepreneurship ecosystem. Fellow start-ups and and mentors, which was for us really the beginning of tapping into some of those valuable connections of entrepreneurs around us, learning from their journeys, their experiences, getting their advice, but also people you know who have many, many years of experience in specific industries and who can connect you to the right people along the way. So I think for us an acceleration program was really  the way to tap into that ecosystem because the ecosystem is here. I feel like sometimes in the Netherlands it can be diffuse and spread out and located in multiple places, unfortunately. But there are some strong connectors in this ecosystem that actively bring people together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. Yeah, that’s exactly what we’re trying to do here at Nucleate! So Keno, can you tell us a little bit about some pros and cons of foreign investment into a local firm? So specifically are there differences in say funding structures that you come across or maybe even something like expectations from a VC when you are say an EU based company and you go out and try and find the best US VC money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KG:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, definitely we could, we could always do more. Yeah, so. I think from a finance
perspective, the ecosystem in the Netherlands is is quite deep. So it’s a history of - it’s a trading nation. You know the stock exchange started here and as I mentioned there’s quite a lot of laws and governance which makes it easy and this is what has evolved now into a very strong venture capital ecosystem so. Now if we look at the leading firms, leading rounds in early stage innovation all the way to crossover are happening here in the Netherlands. You got groups like Forbion, our sister fund, but als LSP/EQT, Gilde, as well as a much broader ecosystem of smaller groups that are really driving the innovation and so there is this spectrum of different pockets of money. Also there’s a lot of regional players that want to encourage innovation in the different areas and and through these you can really build companies and through this spectrum you get to the point where you can attract foreign foreign investor or international investors. And I think as you bring people on board, not necessarily just international investors, but every financing run, it’s very important to keep in mind the governance and how as an entrepreneur you want to build your syndicate and the person that brings in more money, not necessarily is there with the right partners. Sometimes it is, but it’s also very important to keep to keep in mind what culture you want to bring into the companies, like the US, you know, pour lots of money, move as fast as you can. Or take a more paced approach and validate concepts, try to be more capital efficient with a goal that you will sell at a higher multiple based on a lower base of capital invested. So also it’s important to keep in mind time difference! So it’s not the same working with a venture group that has got an office in Boston or New York than having all of your investor syndicate in San Francisco because then you’ll be working all the evenings. So yeah, some of these are considerations that practical considerations that one needs to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; and Jeroen in your work bringing companies to come here to the Netherlands. Does the cultural piece ever play a role? Are there, for example, is it something that you have to help people navigate a little bit as they choose to set up their operations here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JK:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, maybe less with American companies, more with Asian companies. There you see a big cultural change, and there you see sometimes that you can guide them through how the Netherlands works. I think as Dutch entrepreneurs, we can be a bit more competitive, maybe even a bit more arrogant. I was last week at the Bio International Convention in San Diego. And there you see those American entrepreneurs showcasing what they’re doing. And they have the best idea in the world. They’re going to raise millions of money. If you look really close, you’re like, yeah, I’m not sure. But they do showcase it like that. And that’s sometimes with a good story, you get money. And sometimes in the Netherlands, we’re a bit too kind, too hesitant. That helps with the very collaborative ecosystem that we have, because we all want to support each other. But I think there we can learn a lot from Americans. But then the other way around as well, there was a lot of stories about patient-centric research and I think we’re already doing that very well in the Netherlands and already incorporating that very well while that’s in the US. Still they’re like, no, I have a good protein, I’m just going to make medicine. I’m like, no, you’re doing it for a patient. And here in the Netherlands, some factories where they just produce the pills, those people go to those patient organizations, to the hospitals to actually see what they’re doing for and why they sometimes need to be so precise in their production because they’re going to cure it personally. And that’s I think a really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; So with that, we’re on our last five minutes here. So I’d like to open it up to the audience. Anyone has any questions they would like to ask to our panelists, if you can direct it to a singular panelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, very interesting discussion. And my question for Keno, because I know that in America, VCs, they have different strategies. Some are really builders who start with an idea and founders and they start building it into a company and others jump in later. Do you have any
thoughts about that in the Netherlands? Is there a preference here or what do you generally think of that strategy, strategy in the Netherlands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KG:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, my strong preference is for entrepreneurs partnering with BGV. But more broadly, I think this is a very important question that you raised. Think who you want to work with and partner with because likelihood it’s going to be either a very long period that you’re working with that person or it’s going to be very short either because the company doesn’t work or because there’s a change of management. So I think it’s very important to understand what rapport, so intuitively what rapport one is building with the other party and I think this is the right person, this is the right group. Do we share the the goals in terms of how we want to build the company, how we see a potential exit and based on this make a decision. I mean I’ve been on all sorts of boards. So I’ve been in very functional boards where everybody’s very collaborative and there’s a shared vision and that makes it very easy to work and it’s really fun. And I’ve also been in some really dysfunctional boards where it’s every board meetings like the shouting and that’s not fun and it can be very distracting to the mission of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WL:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. If there are no further questions, I’d like to give a round of applause to our panelists today.&lt;/p&gt;

The discussion was moderated (and transcribed!) by William Lake (WL). Panel Overview Panelists will compare the Dutch and American entrepreneurship cultures and discuss the differences, as well as challenges and opportunities this leads to. The panel also creates an opportunity to discuss if startup founders should think about going global from early on, and the mindset shifts this may require. The learning goal for this panel is to understand how Nucleate’s mission can translate at a national level, and how the ecosystem can best benefit from it. The panelists will highlight opportunities and programs that facilitate the mobility of biotech and entrepreneurial talents, companies and investment opportunities between the Netherlands and abroad. The panel will feature four panelists, including members from a Dutch globally diversified biotech VC firm, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency and Health~Holland, as well as an early-stage entrepreneur with experience with the US bio-entreprenurial ecosystem. Discussion Recording Unfortunately, the quality of recording is poor due to technical difficulties on our side. Sorry! To accommodate for this, we have transcribed the full discussion, and you can enable subtitles or read the full transcript below. https://youtu.be/lEXHCKkDLo0?si=s2zH87qKsYb4pXg4 Top Takeaways The Netherlands is a good place to start a deeptech company thanks to a business friendly infrastructure, number of early-stage funding opportunities and a deep talent pool. The Netherlands is, however, a small market and companies must look for growth opportunities abroad from the get go. While there is less capital than in the US, it gets you further. This keeps the environment attractive for VCs who gain the opportunity to earn higher multiple. Mindset shifts to empower Dutch and European bio-entrepreneurs: 1) Failing = Learning, 2) Give-back mentality, 3) Don’t be afraid to ask! Additional Remarks The Netherlands has excellent clinical trial infrastructure. Dutch and European biotechs tend to be patient-centric, including patients from the early on. Discussion Transcript WL: I’d like to invite our next round of panelists down. And while they’re getting down here, thank you all for coming and especially thank you to our panelists. So today’s panel will be focusing on what some of the strengths are of the Dutch local biotech ecosystem, but then also what we can learn from other global biotech ecosystems. So Boston, San Francisco, we have a strong Nucleate presence there. But before we get started, I’d like to introduce our panelists. So from left to right here, we have Cinzia Silvestri. Cinzia is the CEO and co-founder of Bi/ond. She is a Termeer fellow, which she can tell us a little bit about later in the presentation, and holds a PhD in microelectronics from TU Delft. And Bi/ond is a tech bio company that uses microelectronics to develop a human-like system for disease state development. Next we have Keno Gutierrez. He’s a general partner at BioGeneration Ventures. And as part of his role at BGV, the CEO and founder of Brandaris Therapeutics. Prior to BGV, he worked at M Ventures, where he was responsible for pharma and life science investment. And he has a PhD in genetics from UCL London and an MBA from Insead. Next we have Kianti Figler, who is the CEO and co-founder of Upstream Foods. Upstream Foods is a new cultivated seafood company that is using fat cells to create sustainable and healthy cultured seafood products. And lastly, we have Jeroen Krüter, who comes to us from the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency. This is part of Invest in Holland, which tries to get international companies to establish a footprint here in the Netherlands. As part of his time at the NFIA, he also worked with the New York City office in the States. So today we will be focusing on, as I mentioned, what we can learn from some of the other global biotech ecosystems. WL: And so to start us off, I’d like to ask Kianti about your experience starting a company here in the Netherlands. What are some of the strengths of the local Dutch biotech ecosystem? And are you already thinking about scaling abroad with respect to talent, operations and finance? KF: Yeah, I’ll start off by saying thank you for having us. So just to give a little bit of context, I can only speak to my own experience here, but we started from zero. So we’re not a spin out. We didn’t take any IP with us from anywhere. We were a team with an idea, kind of crazy and we figured let’s give it a go. I think for us the early stages here in the Netherlands were great. There’s some small brands that you can apply for and for us that’s what really got us started that little pre-seed funding. Then that next phase, that little bit of a bigger jump in funding was harder for us as a deep tech company. You’re too early for a lot of venture capital. You’re too risky for a lot of the regional development agencies. And we actually went to to Denmark, to the Bioinnovation Institute to apply for funding there. That’s what really allowed us to rent our lab, hire first people and kick it off and get to a point where we are interesting enough for venture capital. I think that the Netherlands is great in terms of talent. There’s really top notch talent here that is excited to work for startups, very mission driven and oriented. So yeah, I mean that has been our journey. I think there’s a lot of value here in terms of talent, grants to support you along the way, mentors who are willing to help out and share their experience. I’d say that’s been my experience so far. As a cultivated seafood company, we would have to apply for novel foods regulation, which means that per definition, the Netherlands, and Europe is kind of a tough market for us to launch in, which means that we are looking to the US to not only scale, but even launch our first product, which is a challenge, but also an opportunity I think. And I think we’re already here in the Netherlands, so let’s move our product activities to the US. WL: And Cinzia, how does that compare and contrast with your experience starting Bi/ond?Are you also feeling some of these regulatory pressures? I know that your company has, for example, lots of partnerships with European hospitals to create these clinically relevant disease states. So are you also thinking about expanding your operations abroad at this point? CS: Yeah, let’s say right now we have around 15 customers between academic hospitals and pharma in Europe and the UK. But of course, like I think every start-up should think from the beginning that they are at least European, if not global start-ups. So the Netherlands is really a nice place to start some product concepts, really get a foot into the ecosystem because there are so many excellence in the academic sector as well as pharmas. But then if you want to be successful, you have to look abroad. So then basically that’s what we are doing right now. By the end of the year, we plan to work the first three customers in the US and this month it will be the biggest big pharma that we have right now that is in the Boston area. So basically it’s like really planning for starting to get a foot at least depending on let’s say the kind of background that your startup has, but an example in our case is going to be Boston is the place to be. And basically like really starting to develop your network there also with other peers, it really has to be in your strategic plan from the start. WL: And Keno, we’ve already touched a little bit on funding. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the difference in the VC field between the US and here in the Netherlands. How easy is it for, you know, young companies to find funding here in the Netherlands? And then also maybe some differences in investment strategies that you might find between the US based and the EU VC. KG: Yeah, absolutely. Good afternoon everyone. Happy to be here. Well so, to come here. I was working from home, took my bike to the train station, took a train, rented another bike and came here. Super easy. And that’s a good analogy for how the infrastructure in the Netherlands is set up. There’s a lot of support for business. There’s very friendly environment for business, very easy to set up a new company. There’s a very good rule of law in terms of corporate law which makes new financings very easy to to come together because it’s very friendly for new investors to to come. There’s an educated workforce, it’s a very deep talent pool, so it’s very easy to recruit people and it’s very well connected. So it’s very easy to put together syndicates from around Europe and the US. So it’s very similar in terms of corporate governance and corporate law compared to the US. So there’s a lot of similarities and at the moment there’s what people call an arbitrage, so difference in what one can get for the same amount of capital here versus in the US particularly in areas like Boston or San Francisco. So that is a key difference because investing here locally we can push things further with the same amount of capital. So there’s some interesting similarities, there’s some differences in general bringing people on board, it’s easy. So as long as there’s good science. I’ll give you a couple of examples. So I work for BGV. We were the founders of a company called Acerta Pharma which got in like and eventually got sold to AstraZeneca for $7 billion. And now we started here in the way we brought in investors from the US, high caliber and, there&apos;s multiple examples, you know, the portfolio will be getting started and then bring US investors and so forth. WL: And then Jeroen, so a lot of your work involves bringing either foreign, US or otherwise companies here to the Netherlands to set up operations. So what are some of the strengths the local Dutch biotech ecosystem has that these companies that are looking to relocate are looking to leverage? JK: I think a lot has already been said by these people and I love that their companies are kind of also ambassadors for life science and health ecosystem. Over the last couple of years, a couple of organizations from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Economic Affairs really figured like, OK, how do we sell the Netherlands to abroad? And we came up with the sentence “Europe’s connected life science and health metropolis”. It’s a bit long, but it will stick at one point. And what does that connectedness say? That can kind of be divided in three things. So first of all, logistics, that’s what the Netherlands is known for. It’s DHL #1 for already like 15 years. So it’s the roads, but it’s definitely also the air for pharma transports Schiphol, but also Maastricht are both pharma gateways for all of Europe. But it’s also digital. We have the fastest fiber internet in Europe here in the Netherlands because we have the Internet Exchange. So we’re already quite good at AI. But now with the merger with life sciences, you see a lot of digital health companies popping up in the Netherlands and choosing the Netherlands for their expansions. The second one is collaboration. That’s already set by the other panelists. So it’s really that collaborative ecosystem working together. How can we create together even more value than we do by ourselves? And the last one is of course talent, very highly educated, English speaking, innovative talent like you guys are. And that’s really a value for the Netherlands and that’s what foreign companies see as an added value and why they would like to move to the Netherlands as well. WL: Great. And then kind of flipping that question on its head, what we do to keep companies here, talent here, for example, Kianti illustrated that maybe she will set up ooperations in the US because of the regulatory environment. Is there stuff that the local ecosystem can do to continue to make it more appealing to keep your operations here? JK: Well, that’s more on the practical side. We need more power and electricity. That’s a bit of an issue now. But for the rest, it’s really trying to continue on that collaborative ecosystem. But also organizations like yours, like Nucleate, making that bridge with America. So it’s actually that physical bridge, having that here showcasing what we can do. And how we even can become better at what we already do? WL: Great. So we’ve touched on kind the local beginnings of a company, right? Like what starting a company is like here in the Netherlands. Most of the most exciting life science companies today are trying to solve global problems as Cinzia mentioned as well. You know, whether that’s agri-tech feeding a world that is increasingly affected by climate change, drug development for an increasing aging population. So for this next topic, and we’ve started to touch on this a little bit already, but I’d like to dive into some of the more cultural and intangible factors perhaps at play here in the Netherlands versus in the US. So Cinzia, you are a Termeer fellow, so first, could you tell us a little bit about what the Termeer Fellowship is? And in your experience as part of being a Termeer Fellow, what are some of the cultural differences that you’ve noticed between, say, US founders or US startup teams and EU founders and EU startup teams? CS: Great. So let’s say a Termeer Fellow is part of our Termeer Foundation that is built up on the legacy of Henri Termeer. Henri Termeer, he was a great entrepreneur that was the CEO of Genzyme. He was the third biggest biotech company back in his days and basically he was sold to Sanofi and he was one of the first in the rare genetic disease space, and rare genetic is really hard business in the pharma sector. And what Henri was always doing is that he was mentoring a lot of first time CEOs and he created basically most of the CEOs that are right now in the Boston area. Unfortunately he passed away and his wife created a foundation based on his legacy to basically help people like me, first time CEOs, to connect with these great mentors that already have been there multiple times, so in all the ups and downs of the startups field. And basically as Henri was Dutch, I got the opportunity to have a special scholarship that is called Transatlantic Connection. That basically every year is given to a Dutch entrepreneur to connect to the Boston area. And that’s actually in one year time I had the opportunity to really learn a lot first hand about what is the Boston ecosystem, who are the major player because they have the opportunity to talk to these mentors, but also networking and knowing your peers and you will definitely see a bit of difference there and I will touch upon two main aspects. The first one is the fear of failure. Every first-time CEO is afraid to fail. The one that did it multiple times, they really don’t care. They really take it as a proud moment because when they fail they learn a lot. But definitely like here is seen a bit more as a stigma and sometimes it stop us even from taking action. So don’t be afraid if you think you have a good idea, it is never the right time, just try and worst case you’re going to fail, but you have to learn a lot and that’s what I’m also trying to digest sometimes. And the second thing is the give back mentality. There is a great ecosystem there and the people that have done this journey before, they are always open to give you feedback. And to help you out, also sponsoring you, some of them are going to be your Angel investors or they’re going to be your advisor. An important thing that we have to learn is to ask. If you don’t ask, you don’t, you don’t get anything out of it. So it’s really important for us or everybody to keep on asking people if they can connect you with someone and for them, for people in the US probably it’s easier and also give back mentality when you’re getting somewhere. Remember what you all through the way and do the same with the new generation. WL: Great. And Kianti, do you have some of the same experiences? So starting a new company, as you said, you were a couple people basically with an idea. What was your process like finding mentorship and people who can help you kind of start actually getting this company off the ground? KF: Yeah, I can definitely relate to the first time CEO experience of being afraid to fail. I had to really shut that off in my brain, like, OK, that is a given that might happen, accept it, move on from it and and try anyways. I think for us, we were part of the Start Life Incubation Program at Wageningen, which really opened the door for us to an ecosystem, to an entrepreneurship ecosystem. Fellow start-ups and and mentors, which was for us really the beginning of tapping into some of those valuable connections of entrepreneurs around us, learning from their journeys, their experiences, getting their advice, but also people you know who have many, many years of experience in specific industries and who can connect you to the right people along the way. So I think for us an acceleration program was really the way to tap into that ecosystem because the ecosystem is here. I feel like sometimes in the Netherlands it can be diffuse and spread out and located in multiple places, unfortunately. But there are some strong connectors in this ecosystem that actively bring people together. WL: Great. Yeah, that’s exactly what we’re trying to do here at Nucleate! So Keno, can you tell us a little bit about some pros and cons of foreign investment into a local firm? So specifically are there differences in say funding structures that you come across or maybe even something like expectations from a VC when you are say an EU based company and you go out and try and find the best US VC money? KG: Yeah, definitely we could, we could always do more. Yeah, so. I think from a finance perspective, the ecosystem in the Netherlands is is quite deep. So it’s a history of - it’s a trading nation. You know the stock exchange started here and as I mentioned there’s quite a lot of laws and governance which makes it easy and this is what has evolved now into a very strong venture capital ecosystem so. Now if we look at the leading firms, leading rounds in early stage innovation all the way to crossover are happening here in the Netherlands. You got groups like Forbion, our sister fund, but als LSP/EQT, Gilde, as well as a much broader ecosystem of smaller groups that are really driving the innovation and so there is this spectrum of different pockets of money. Also there’s a lot of regional players that want to encourage innovation in the different areas and and through these you can really build companies and through this spectrum you get to the point where you can attract foreign foreign investor or international investors. And I think as you bring people on board, not necessarily just international investors, but every financing run, it’s very important to keep in mind the governance and how as an entrepreneur you want to build your syndicate and the person that brings in more money, not necessarily is there with the right partners. Sometimes it is, but it’s also very important to keep to keep in mind what culture you want to bring into the companies, like the US, you know, pour lots of money, move as fast as you can. Or take a more paced approach and validate concepts, try to be more capital efficient with a goal that you will sell at a higher multiple based on a lower base of capital invested. So also it’s important to keep in mind time difference! So it’s not the same working with a venture group that has got an office in Boston or New York than having all of your investor syndicate in San Francisco because then you’ll be working all the evenings. So yeah, some of these are considerations that practical considerations that one needs to keep in mind. WL: and Jeroen in your work bringing companies to come here to the Netherlands. Does the cultural piece ever play a role? Are there, for example, is it something that you have to help people navigate a little bit as they choose to set up their operations here? JK: Yeah, maybe less with American companies, more with Asian companies. There you see a big cultural change, and there you see sometimes that you can guide them through how the Netherlands works.

And that’s I think a really great. WL: So with that, we’re on our last five minutes here. So I’d like to open it up to the audience. Anyone has any questions they would like to ask to our panelists, if you can direct it to a singular panelist. Audience: Yeah, very interesting discussion. And my question for Keno, because I know that in America, VCs, they have different strategies.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;panel-overview&quot;&gt;Panel Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists will discuss technology transfer capabilities across the Netherlands and highlight challenges and opportunities for PhD and Postdoc entrepreneurs in the country. The discussion will address strategies to raise awareness among biotech researchers about the funding and acceleration programs available, and, more broadly, how to foster an entrepreneurial mindset in academia. Representatives from Biotech Booster, unlock_ , programs of technology transfer, and VC will comment on how they are contributing to fostering and supporting Dutch entrepreneurship and mention challenges they face. The session includes 4 panelists from these programs. Q&amp;amp;A will offer students and postdocs in the audience the opportunity to reflect on their experience and perceived strengths and challenges in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-takeaways&quot;&gt;Top Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a clear need to inspire more early career researchers about entrepreneurial careers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are not enough entrepreneurship-focused events for PhDs and postdocs, and Nucleate can contribute at this interface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a need to stimulate collaboration and knowledge sharing between individual academic and value creation centers (universities, TTOs, incubators, …).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge institutions can be more proactive in establishing networks and regular interactions with investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-remarks&quot;&gt;Additional Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investors in the Netherlands are relatively open to being approached by founders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Netherlands has a decentralized biotech ecosystem. This helps to avoid neglect of some regions, but it also creates fragmentation of resources and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TTO’s (in the Netherlands) are a good early point of contact for entrepreneurial researchers.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Of note: Great research does not automatically mean a great patent and vice versa, both are however valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is existing and regular interaction between some early-stage VCs and TTO’s and incubators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-transcript&quot;&gt;Discussion Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; I’d like to invite our first round of panelists. So I’ll just remind you that in our first round we’ll look at what is here in the Dutch startup ecosystem, what is here to support the biotech founders or, maybe, the prospective biotech founders. And I’ll now introduce the panelists to you. Who really have an expertise in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So coming from the left to right, Eleanor Price. Eleanor Price is an associate at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thujacapital.com/&quot;&gt;Thuja Capital&lt;/a&gt;. Thuja Capital is an early stage healthcare VC fund based here in Utrecht. And Eleanor is an associate who focuses on sourcing and assessing promising investment opportunities, maybe your investment opportunity, and conducting due diligence. She finished her PhD in the UK. She is native to the UK, and her Phd in Oxford, in regenerative medicine. She holds an MBA as well, and worked in PanaceaStars, which is an accelerator and incubation program in Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next speaker is Nettie Buitelaar. Nettie Buitelaar is possibly the best connected person, or one of the best connected persons in the Dutch biotech, so catch her in the break as well. She did a PhD as well in Wageningen so where Elena is doing her PhD now. But then on, she went to do a range of investment, and also management, roles. And currently she’s the CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://biotechbooster.nl/&quot;&gt;Biotech Booster&lt;/a&gt;, which is a national program that is aiming to translate more innovations from academia, but also from industry into value and companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have Lorenzo Bombardelli. Lorenzo did his PhD in the US, actually, and then eventually went on to do a postdoc in Italy, and in the Netherlands at Dutch Cancer Institute. There he worked for a couple of years and came up with an innovation that resulted in a company that he co-founded. At the moment, he’s working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://luris.nl/&quot;&gt;a technology transfer office&lt;/a&gt;, aside from being a founder, in Leiden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, Stéfan. Stéfan Ellenbroek is the director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plnt.nl/en/programs/unlock_-incubation/&quot;&gt;unlock_&lt;/a&gt; program. unlock_ is a quite unique program based in Leiden. It’s an accelerator program and an incubator program where early-stage companies can come, be matched with mentors, and eventually be also connected to sources of funding. Stefan studied in Utrecht, but eventually went to assume a range of management and also community building roles. And I think unlock_ is  fitting him perfectly at the moment because there he does what he likes the best, and that’s helping early stage founders like you, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel1_carrousel.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so with this intro, I would like you to give a hand to our speakers. I will start with my first question to Lorenzo, actually. So given your experience at a technology transfer office in Leiden, can you maybe speak to the founders here in the audience, prospective founders, and tell them more about what the technology transfer office does? And how do you connect with students, PhDs and postdocs? And in this case, who initiates the conversation? Do they come to you or you come to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure. So at the tech transfer office, essentially our job is to valorize intellectual property,  &lt;inaudible&gt; and &lt;inaudible&gt;. So that&apos;s what we do. So we decide, you know, what happens. Whether it&apos;s after a certain invention or for an existing one. where there is a fee, license-out. But we also see an increase -- I would say most of our work now is revolving around startups, so that&apos;s our preferred way to valorize. And usually, it&apos;s the founders, the researchers that come to us. So if you have an idea. But we also, you know, start spending more and more time actively scouting. Yeah, I mean, sometimes professors say, hey, what we invented could be patented. And it is worth it, so there&apos;s more and more.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; And how many people do you speak to on average at this junction? And what is the technology readiness level this happens at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;inaudible&gt; So yeah, so we have a lot of early stage innovation. &lt;inaudible&gt;&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Then maybe I would like to move over to Stéfan. And so we spoke about founders, maybe understanding when they have an innovation that is marketable. And at one point, they are approaching maybe you as an incubator. So if you could describe the role of _unlock in the local regional ecosystem, but also the national ecosystem. And do you think that enough PhD students, or postdocs know about you, or maybe more of them should know about you, and what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you. My idea is to make ourselves well known. unlock_ is an active incubator program. So this is what I’m also doing, trying to educate people, together with other professionals always. Then pre-incubation. So when people become activated, then, well, this might be fun for me. Then if there is an invention, people with an idea, and we think that this might work. Then they can come to us and then think, hey, am I the right person to bring this idea to a fruition, so to the market, or to the patient? Because we’re working on life sciences. And most of Leiden is focused on life sciences. When you are pre-incubated, then you get a little bit of VC funding, then you move into the incubation program, which is where you become more active, get some team around you, hire people, outsource certain experiments like animal experiments and all that. And then in the accelerator programs, you really move towards &lt;inaudible&gt;.  But it all starts with people that have either a very good idea or, well, press their heads against a very big problem for everybody, and then they find a solution to that together with us and their team.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; So you described the incubation role and the accelerator role. Are you active in both?  &lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the entire process.  &lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; And can you speak maybe to the size of your cohorts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well, it depends. So we are still growing. So we’re now approaching about, I think, 52 companies at this moment. In total, in the incubation program, we generally have a number of pre-incubator companies, people who just speak to our team. We now are at with bit above 750 students, PhD and MSc, these are the students that we reach for the pre-activation and inspiration. And yeah, for the scale-ups, it’s about 20. So the accelerated ones are about 20. And we coach them for a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; So that’s pretty impressive in terms of numbers, I have to say. Would you comment on how you source your mentors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well, it really helps that we are in Leiden. Well, the Utrecht Science Park is also very big, but Leiden is way bigger commercially-wise. That’s sort of way more .. It’s actually not that hard to get all the coaches and mentors through our local network that we already had, because we were working already with many of the CEOs. That’s been done for many years. And actually, Nettie is  also part of the ecosystem. But yeah, we could simply ask, and we never are lacking enough local entrepreneurs to help mentor &lt;inaudible&gt;.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for sharing. So I will now move over to Eleanor and ask her, how does she interact with incubators and TTOs, maybe not only you, but in general VCs in the Netherlands. Can you maybe speak to the value that these institutions give to you when you are doing due diligence, or sourcing the tech? And would you like to see more interaction at this interface? Is there too much of it? Just enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, sure. So yeah, we actually work a lot with the accelerators and incubators based in the Netherlands and Belgium where our investment focus is. As an early stage investor, it’s really a valuable source of deal flow for us. I think one thing that we see is, it’s quite often the same faces in these accelerators and incubators. So I think it’s really important to increase the amount of entrepreneurship within the Netherlands and increase the number of postdocs and PhDs that are coming to these programmes. So that we don’t see the same faces throughout. And then we also work a lot with the TTOs based in the Netherlands as well. So we are well connected with the TTOs and knowledge institutions and we actually have quarterly update meetings with them where they present to us early stage projects that they’re thinking might they might spin out from universities and so we can provide early stage feedback for that and that really acts as deal flow for us and then helps the TTOs and knowledge institutes recognise which … which ideas might be worth spinning out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Could you maybe speak to the origin of this interface for both TTOs and incubators. &lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt; As in the partnership that we have?  &lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt; So it’s, we’re based here in Utrecht actually, and so it originally started with Utrecht Holdings, so we’ve had a very long time relationship with them right from the first fund that we had in 2008. And so it started there and then just over the years we’ve built up our network within the Netherlands. And I would say it’s more proactive from probably the Thuja’s side with establishing these collaborations. And so I think it would be great going forward as well to have some more kind of proactive outreach for the knowledge institutions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; I have one question that I would like to ask you because you did your PhD in the UK and were involved in the startups here and there as well. And we will be addressing the issue of culture, and maybe some needed changes in the culture. Have you seen differences there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt; So I would say yes and no. So when I started my PhD, I think about eight, nine years ago, I think the ecosystem there was also very underdeveloped, and it was not something that was talked about readily. As I, throughout my PhD, it became more and more common and spoken about, but that… It’s also in very specific sectors in the UK. So in Oxford, London, and Cambridge, it’s much more established, whereas in other regions in the UK, less so. And I think that in the Netherlands, it’s quite a similar story, that you go to some universities, and I think there’s much more of a– I think there’s been experience with it. You have, for example, in London, you have a lot of CEOs and success stories, and that kind of builds the culture a bit more around it. And so I think it, yeah, it depends on the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I remember reading that in the UK, about 80% of all funding is consumed by the London area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it’s very, very concentrated in one area. So I think one is geographically small. So you can be one combined ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; So the final question for this block is to Nettie. First, if you may speak a bit about Biotech Booster and which gaps it has been designed to address, how it interfaces with stakeholders that spoke before you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel1_003.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, well. I think we’ll spend the rest of the time. Well, we have about the same mission as Nucleate, so that we want to make sure that valuable biotech research reaches the market or makes it there faster, because that’s the only way that that society can benefit from all the research that we’re doing. So that’s the background of the whole program. And we have a few instruments. We have about 250 million euros in that growth fund. And we will use this for several things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we have a project. We can grant projects. We have 2 rounds of projects. One will be 200K, 200’000, and one will be 1.9 million. So you can you can apply for those grants. The portal has been open since about one month, and we can fund about 55 this year, and we have a pipeline of over 130 at the moment, so there is competition. But we want the best, of course, to get funded. So that’s one thing that we have. So that’s open, especially the small projects of the 200k, which is still quite substantial, I’d say, that’s only open for knowledge institutes and universities and universities of applied science. They can apply and they can partner, of course, with universities and companies and other organizations. So it’s open to everybody, but the channel has to be knowledge institutes. So that’s the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then second one have, we have a network of 39 people and business developers that we fund throughout all technology transfer in the Netherlands who want to participate in the program. So we have them in the cities where there is  biotech activities going on, we add extra people to the technology transfer offices. So we call ourselves an extra tool in the toolbox of the TTOs and we help them to do the scouting work, as Stefan was describing, because they always are short on people. So we put extra people dedicated to biotech in these offices. And what is also, it may sound small, but it’s still quite a change and you already mentioned that the country is full, but still, sometimes there are pillars between, there are walls between the different cities. And with the system that we have with those business developers, we actually force, or we stimulate, to put it that way, we stimulate collaboration between all the cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And actually, last week, I was at the opening of a new building from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson in Leiden, and the general manager there came to me, and he said, oh, the Biotech Booster is so important for us? But I said, why so? You have enough money. But then he said, no, it’s not the money, but it’s the fact that universities finally will collaborate together. So that’s one of the more cultural things I think that we should change, that we’re trying to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last thing that we also do is that, again, like Stéfan was also mentioning and that you will also have, we have a large network of seasoned entrepreneurs in biotech who will be mentors, coaching, forming virtual boards, et cetera. So we will involve them as well. So we might see the same people there with you and you all the time, but it doesn’t matter. Everybody always likes to participate, and they like to lend their expertise and their knowledge. Yeah, yeah it’s our mission to bring in more new faces. So hopefully we will see these too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we’re trying. Okay, thank you for sharing very much. You already mentioned that you are interacting with other institutes, as TTOs. I would now like to speak to not the role of the people there.  More to the individual researchers, who interact with TTO. So you’re working on innovation that is potentially patentable. There’s some people in the audience maybe doing that as well. We as PhDs don’t have a good knowledge of the innovation creation or knowledge creation process, the patent creation process. Do you think that people should be carrying some sort of knowledge that they are maybe creating something valuable to give them a leverage to maybe start a company afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, of course, but it’s not that easy. So patents, you know, are these mysterious things, everybody thinks that are so, you know, you have a patent and then money just comes. It’s not like that. You have to explain to a researcher what is a valuable research result of a great paper and what is a great patent. It’s not necessarily the same. Actually, patents sometimes may need boring data nobody wants to generate. I find that is sort of the most difficult thing to explain. Of course, we do it when when you know researchers come to us to do it, they have a patent &lt;inaudible&gt;.  And even then we have to have this conversation. Sometimes it&apos;s difficult. You have fantastic research. But not a good patent. You know? So indeed, if ... If we manage to sort of, you know, just be more present, in research, manage to sort of explain what this means. I think PhDs and postdocs will pick it up quite easily. And they will understand and develop, you know, side by side both the research and their, I would say, possibly industrial or startup career.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that’s something that we feel at Nucleate that there is relatively little work that needs to be put in when it comes to informing PhD students about the opportunities that are already there. But as you know over these years, it can be quite empowering and transformative for their work. Okay, next question, I’m going to move over to Eleanor with something similar actually. So investors will often tell you that it’s extremely important to start building relationships with them, even before you start thinking about a company or as early as you have a company. And I would like to ask, have you seen this happening enough? Are there enough opportunities for people like you to build relationships with innovators? And do you think that maybe the PhDs should be approaching you more or you? And as an investor, should you be creating more opportunities for researchers as well? Um How do you feel about this interaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, so I think as the VC we do some proactive outreach to researchers, but it tends to be I would say more at the professor level and interaction with the professor about their expertise and then we might then get on to discuss their own research. So I think for PhDs and postdocs, it’s really valuable to have these initiatives such as Nucleate. I didn’t have any idea what a VC was when I was doing my PhD until I got involved with a student-run organization that was focused on increasing entrepreneurship. And so I think it’s really valuable to have these initiatives that can educate postdocs and PhDs so that they know they need to go out and speak to a VC. I would love to see more people being proactive and coming out to reach out to us. So we’re based in the Life Science Incubator, which is 10 minutes walk from here, and it’s in the middle of the university, Utrecht University Medical Centre, and no one has ever come knocking on our door just to reach out and speak to us. And I would love it if someone did, but no one ever has, so it would be great to &lt;inaudible&gt;. Yeah, exactly. [VCs are not those] scary people that you can&apos;t speak to, so I think it would be great to have more proactive PhDs and postdocs. and more events such as these meetings.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so would you maybe say that you as a VC maybe need to also make not the full step, but the half step? Yes, I’d say we always come to these kinds of events, so I think that there’s not enough of these events. Compared to UK, in London, like you know every week there’s an event for biotech, and as well in Oxford and Cambridge, and I think there’s very few of them here. And I think  …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; I am quite busy with them. &lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; I told you she is the most connected panelist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EP:&lt;/strong&gt; But I think, I mean more at the kind of the more student level, and so having these kind of more informal things that for students I think is very valuable. I think, yeah, there are a lot more of them actually at the startup stage. But I think that within the academic setting, I think it’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for sharing. I would have a question for Stéfan now. So in your capacity, you already mentioned working with founders, also students, you mentioned 750, 20 plus scaleup. In my experience, the PhD education didn’t include much of an entrepreneurial aspect. And if I was interested in something, I would have to go searching. Do you also work with universities on the master level, but maybe also for this audience on the PhD level? Do you put in maybe an entrepreneurship course or teach the students more about venture creation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel1_002.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we do that, and it’s not easy. Actually, it’s almost as hard to get into one course, either graduate school or a master studies, it doesn’t really matter, as to do the entire course itself. So it takes a lot of time. That’s too bad. But in Leiden, we will now do it for every Master and PhD student, so in every track it will be in. So that’s quite a big breakthrough in four years from now &lt;inaudible&gt;. I&apos;m starting conversations also with other universities, and we only focus on life science, and also not for every university, but Utrecht is one of them. As it is my alma-mater, it&apos;s easier. But that that is, I think, really necessary, because I I think most of you, as PhD students, don&apos;t really realize, that if you apply for funding, even if you want to be a basic scientist, so really normal, doing research just for research, you have to describe how the knowledge will be used, the implementation paragraph, as they call it. And so you have to understand how this works. And that&apos;s part of also what I always try to convey, even if you don&apos;t want to be an entrepreneur yourself, It is crucial that you think about, okay, why should we, or the society, fund this research, you know even in order to become a successful scientist yourself. But when you want to be a, potentially you want to found a company, you really should be aware of, well, the entire scala, .... , all the stuff that you need to do. And know how to find the people that can help you.&lt;/inaudible&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so you talked about PhD education and also the PhD program. And then I have a final question for Nettie, because she’s seen the culture for some amount of time. And I wonder, did it change the culture? Is it easier to start companies? Are people more courageous now? And what is still missing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, maybe it’s funny to tell that after my PhD I joined an MBA. And I wrote my master thesis there, and I think it was in 1998 on spinning out biotech science from academia and science in general. And at that time I was going to all the universities because TTOs, technology transfer offices, weren’t around. Yes, most of them were not there. And then some people, they just said, OK. Our commercialization effort is just some merchandise with cups. So that was really very early, but there was also this was of course at the one end, and there were also others like Twente, which was the earliest in entrepreneurship. At the time, meetings like these were not around that it wouldn’t have happened. And many people also, they were a bit angry of me. So why would you do that? I mean, that’s not ethical, because science is for science. I think we’ve come a long way since then, but we’re still not where we should be. I think education is one important thing, and also creating role models, and making it a normal or regular way to become an entrepreneur, or to be somewhere in the interface between science and business, not just become a professor and have the highest goal to become a professor. I mean, you can do much more with science than just being in research, although it’s all based in research. But I think we’re so lucky to have good brains , all the people here and we meet, they are  people with good brains, and who can and employ them for society and well, make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s a nice note to end on. &lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that’s my main motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Well before we leave you, actually, I would like to leave the audience to ask questions. We have time for one or two questions at the moment. So think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; When you think about it, I still have one thing to mention. We’re looking for people. So if you’re interested in working with us in our office to make the Biotech Booster program work. Reach out to us, or Dorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Can you say to whom you would like to address the question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUDIENCE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think this is more like a general question, so I’m not very sure who I should ask. So is it OK for you to speak naturally– Yeah, I’m from NKI. In my institute, everyone is focused on science problems. So the science problem and the question in industry have a distance, I think. And the problem is how do we form a science question and to solve an industry problem, and which kind of question we should ask, like which kind of problem industry or society really care, and how do we know this question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Well, I think all of us play a role there. Yeah. So if you are working in science, maybe you should first go to the TTO. And then the TTO helps you out to participate in the incubator program or in an incubator in another location. Then you come to us for funding and then you go to Eleanor for more funding. It depends on the stage where you are. So I think all of us play a role there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so your first step would be the TTO. If you have even just a vague idea of what the specific question to ask would be, but you’re not sure, come to the TTO. That’s what we do on a regular basis, you know, to help people achieve their ideas. And it happens quite often that people come in with examples and technology and they think they only thought about one application. And then there’s another perfect application of that technology, maybe even like some other groups you can work with or a company. And you know that’s what we do. This happens quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MH:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, thanks. In view of time, I will close the discussion now. If there are more questions, now it’s the coffee break. So you can ask them. But before that, give a hand to our panelists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/launchNL_panel1_000.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="startup" /><category term="nucleate" /><category term="biotech" /><summary type="html">This is a summary and a transcript from panel discussion “Strengthening and Connecting the Dutch Entrepreneurial Landscape”, that we hosted at the Nucleate Netherlands Launch Event, on 11th of June in Utrecht. Panel Overview Panelists will discuss technology transfer capabilities across the Netherlands and highlight challenges and opportunities for PhD and Postdoc entrepreneurs in the country. The discussion will address strategies to raise awareness among biotech researchers about the funding and acceleration programs available, and, more broadly, how to foster an entrepreneurial mindset in academia. Representatives from Biotech Booster, unlock_ , programs of technology transfer, and VC will comment on how they are contributing to fostering and supporting Dutch entrepreneurship and mention challenges they face. The session includes 4 panelists from these programs. Q&amp;amp;A will offer students and postdocs in the audience the opportunity to reflect on their experience and perceived strengths and challenges in the ecosystem. Discussion Recording Unfortunately, the quality of recording is poor due to technical difficulties on our side. Sorry! To accommodate for this, we have transcribed the full discussion, and you can enable subtitles or read the full transcript below. https://youtu.be/FPcAicJyADw?feature=shared Top Takeaways There is a clear need to inspire more early career researchers about entrepreneurial careers. There are not enough entrepreneurship-focused events for PhDs and postdocs, and Nucleate can contribute at this interface. There is a need to stimulate collaboration and knowledge sharing between individual academic and value creation centers (universities, TTOs, incubators, …). Knowledge institutions can be more proactive in establishing networks and regular interactions with investors. Additional Remarks Investors in the Netherlands are relatively open to being approached by founders. The Netherlands has a decentralized biotech ecosystem. This helps to avoid neglect of some regions, but it also creates fragmentation of resources and knowledge. TTO’s (in the Netherlands) are a good early point of contact for entrepreneurial researchers. Of note: Great research does not automatically mean a great patent and vice versa, both are however valuable. There is existing and regular interaction between some early-stage VCs and TTO’s and incubators. Discussion Transcript MH: I’d like to invite our first round of panelists. So I’ll just remind you that in our first round we’ll look at what is here in the Dutch startup ecosystem, what is here to support the biotech founders or, maybe, the prospective biotech founders. And I’ll now introduce the panelists to you. Who really have an expertise in these areas. So coming from the left to right, Eleanor Price. Eleanor Price is an associate at Thuja Capital. Thuja Capital is an early stage healthcare VC fund based here in Utrecht. And Eleanor is an associate who focuses on sourcing and assessing promising investment opportunities, maybe your investment opportunity, and conducting due diligence. She finished her PhD in the UK. She is native to the UK, and her Phd in Oxford, in regenerative medicine. She holds an MBA as well, and worked in PanaceaStars, which is an accelerator and incubation program in Oxford. Next speaker is Nettie Buitelaar. Nettie Buitelaar is possibly the best connected person, or one of the best connected persons in the Dutch biotech, so catch her in the break as well. She did a PhD as well in Wageningen so where Elena is doing her PhD now. But then on, she went to do a range of investment, and also management, roles. And currently she’s the CEO of Biotech Booster, which is a national program that is aiming to translate more innovations from academia, but also from industry into value and companies. Next we have Lorenzo Bombardelli. Lorenzo did his PhD in the US, actually, and then eventually went on to do a postdoc in Italy, and in the Netherlands at Dutch Cancer Institute. There he worked for a couple of years and came up with an innovation that resulted in a company that he co-founded. At the moment, he’s working at a technology transfer office, aside from being a founder, in Leiden. And finally, Stéfan. Stéfan Ellenbroek is the director of the unlock_ program. unlock_ is a quite unique program based in Leiden. It’s an accelerator program and an incubator program where early-stage companies can come, be matched with mentors, and eventually be also connected to sources of funding. Stefan studied in Utrecht, but eventually went to assume a range of management and also community building roles. And I think unlock_ is fitting him perfectly at the moment because there he does what he likes the best, and that’s helping early stage founders like you, maybe. OK, so with this intro, I would like you to give a hand to our speakers. I will start with my first question to Lorenzo, actually. So given your experience at a technology transfer office in Leiden, can you maybe speak to the founders here in the audience, prospective founders, and tell them more about what the technology transfer office does? And how do you connect with students, PhDs and postdocs? And in this case, who initiates the conversation? Do they come to you or you come to them? LB: Sure. So at the tech transfer office, essentially our job is to valorize intellectual property, and . So that&apos;s what we do. So we decide, you know, what happens. Whether it&apos;s after a certain invention or for an existing one. where there is a fee, license-out. But we also see an increase -- I would say most of our work now is revolving around startups, so that&apos;s our preferred way to valorize. And usually, it&apos;s the founders, the researchers that come to us. So if you have an idea. But we also, you know, start spending more and more time actively scouting. Yeah, I mean, sometimes professors say, hey, what we invented could be patented. And it is worth it, so there&apos;s more and more. MH: And how many people do you speak to on average at this junction? And what is the technology readiness level this happens at? LB: So yeah, so we have a lot of early stage innovation. MH: Then maybe I would like to move over to Stéfan. And so we spoke about founders, maybe understanding when they have an innovation that is marketable. And at one point, they are approaching maybe you as an incubator. So if you could describe the role of _unlock in the local regional ecosystem, but also the national ecosystem. And do you think that enough PhD students, or postdocs know about you, or maybe more of them should know about you, and what can we do about it? SE: Thank you. My idea is to make ourselves well known. unlock_ is an active incubator program. So this is what I’m also doing, trying to educate people, together with other professionals always. Then pre-incubation. So when people become activated, then, well, this might be fun for me. Then if there is an invention, people with an idea, and we think that this might work. Then they can come to us and then think, hey, am I the right person to bring this idea to a fruition, so to the market, or to the patient? Because we’re working on life sciences. And most of Leiden is focused on life sciences. When you are pre-incubated, then you get a little bit of VC funding, then you move into the incubation program, which is where you become more active, get some team around you, hire people, outsource certain experiments like animal experiments and all that. And then in the accelerator programs, you really move towards . But it all starts with people that have either a very good idea or, well, press their heads against a very big problem for everybody, and then they find a solution to that together with us and their team. MH: So you described the incubation role and the accelerator role. Are you active in both? SE: Yes, the entire process. MH: And can you speak maybe to the size of your cohorts? SE: Yeah, well, it depends. So we are still growing. So we’re now approaching about, I think, 52 companies at this moment. In total, in the incubation program, we generally have a number of pre-incubator companies, people who just speak to our team. We now are at with bit above 750 students, PhD and MSc, these are the students that we reach for the pre-activation and inspiration. And yeah, for the scale-ups, it’s about 20. So the accelerated ones are about 20. And we coach them for a longer period of time. MH: So that’s pretty impressive in terms of numbers, I have to say. Would you comment on how you source your mentors? SE: Yeah, well, it really helps that we are in Leiden. Well, the Utrecht Science Park is also very big, but Leiden is way bigger commercially-wise. That’s sort of way more .. It’s actually not that hard to get all the coaches and mentors through our local network that we already had, because we were working already with many of the CEOs. That’s been done for many years. And actually, Nettie is also part of the ecosystem. But yeah, we could simply ask, and we never are lacking enough local entrepreneurs to help mentor . MH: Thanks for sharing. So I will now move over to Eleanor and ask her, how does she interact with incubators and TTOs, maybe not only you, but in general VCs in the Netherlands. Can you maybe speak to the value that these institutions give to you when you are doing due diligence, or sourcing the tech? And would you like to see more interaction at this interface? Is there too much of it? Just enough? EP:Yeah, sure. So yeah, we actually work a lot with the accelerators and incubators based in the Netherlands and Belgium where our investment focus is. As an early stage investor, it’s really a valuable source of deal flow for us. I think one thing that we see is, it’s quite often the same faces in these accelerators and incubators. So I think it’s really important to increase the amount of entrepreneurship within the Netherlands and increase the number of postdocs and PhDs that are coming to these programmes. So that we don’t see the same faces throughout. And then we also work a lot with the TTOs based in the Netherlands as well. So we are well connected with the TTOs and knowledge institutions and we actually have quarterly update meetings with them where they present to us early stage projects that they’re thinking might they might spin out from universities and so we can provide early stage feedback for that and that really acts as deal flow for us and then helps the TTOs and knowledge institutes recognise which … which ideas might be worth spinning out. MH: Could you maybe speak to the origin of this interface for both TTOs and incubators. EP: As in the partnership that we have? MH: Yes. EP: So it’s, we’re based here in Utrecht actually, and so it originally started with Utrecht Holdings, so we’ve had a very long time relationship with them right from the first fund that we had in 2008. And so it started there and then just over the years we’ve built up our network within the Netherlands. And I would say it’s more proactive from probably the Thuja’s side with establishing these collaborations. And so I think it would be great going forward as well to have some more kind of proactive outreach for the knowledge institutions as well. MH: I have one question that I would like to ask you because you did your PhD in the UK and were involved in the startups here and there as well. And we will be addressing the issue of culture, and maybe some needed changes in the culture. Have you seen differences there? EP: So I would say yes and no. So when I started my PhD, I think about eight, nine years ago, I think the ecosystem there was also very underdeveloped, and it was not something that was talked about readily. As I, throughout my PhD, it became more and more common and spoken about, but that… It’s also in very specific sectors in the UK. So in Oxford, London, and Cambridge, it’s much more established, whereas in other regions in the UK, less so. And I think that in the Netherlands, it’s quite a similar story, that you go to some universities, and I think there’s much more of a– I think there’s been experience with it. You have, for example, in London, you have a lot of CEOs and success stories, and that kind of builds the culture a bit more around it. And so I think it, yeah, it depends on the region. MH: Yeah, I remember reading that in the UK, about 80% of all funding is consumed by the London area. EP: Yeah. Yeah, it’s very, very concentrated in one area. So I think one is geographically small. So you can be one combined ecosystem MH: So the final question for this block is to Nettie. First, if you may speak a bit about Biotech Booster and which gaps it has been designed to address, how it interfaces with stakeholders that spoke before you. NB: OK, well. I think we’ll spend the rest of the time. Well, we have about the same mission as Nucleate, so that we want to make sure that valuable biotech research reaches the market or makes it there faster, because that’s the only way that that society can benefit from all the research that we’re doing. So that’s the background of the whole program. And we have a few instruments. We have about 250 million euros in that growth fund. And we will use this for several things. First of all, we have a project. We can grant projects. We have 2 rounds of projects. One will be 200K, 200’000, and one will be 1.9 million. So you can you can apply for those grants. The portal has been open since about one month, and we can fund about 55 this year, and we have a pipeline of over 130 at the moment, so there is competition. But we want the best, of course, to get funded. So that’s one thing that we have. So that’s open, especially the small projects of the 200k, which is still quite substantial, I’d say, that’s only open for knowledge institutes and universities and universities of applied science. They can apply and they can partner, of course, with universities and companies and other organizations. So it’s open to everybody, but the channel has to be knowledge institutes. So that’s the money. Then second one have, we have a network of 39 people and business developers that we fund throughout all technology transfer in the Netherlands who want to participate in the program. So we have them in the cities where there is biotech activities going on, we add extra people to the technology transfer offices. So we call ourselves an extra tool in the toolbox of the TTOs and we help them to do the scouting work, as Stefan was describing, because they always are short on people. So we put extra people dedicated to biotech in these offices. And what is also, it may sound small, but it’s still quite a change and you already mentioned that the country is full, but still, sometimes there are pillars between, there are walls between the different cities. And with the system that we have with those business developers, we actually force, or we stimulate, to put it that way, we stimulate collaboration between all the cities. And actually, last week, I was at the opening of a new building from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson in Leiden, and the general manager there came to me, and he said, oh, the Biotech Booster is so important for us? But I said, why so? You have enough money. But then he said, no, it’s not the money, but it’s the fact that universities finally will collaborate together. So that’s one of the more cultural things I think that we should change, that we’re trying to change. And the last thing that we also do is that, again, like Stéfan was also mentioning and that you will also have, we have a large network of seasoned entrepreneurs in biotech who will be mentors, coaching, forming virtual boards, et cetera. So we will involve them as well. So we might see the same people there with you and you all the time, but it doesn’t matter. Everybody always likes to participate, and they like to lend their expertise and their knowledge. Yeah, yeah it’s our mission to bring in more new faces. So hopefully we will see these too. MH: Yes, we’re trying. Okay, thank you for sharing very much. You already mentioned that you are interacting with other institutes, as TTOs. I would now like to speak to not the role of the people there. More to the individual researchers, who interact with TTO. So you’re working on innovation that is potentially patentable. There’s some people in the audience maybe doing that as well. We as PhDs don’t have a good knowledge of the innovation creation or knowledge creation process, the patent creation process. Do you think that people should be carrying some sort of knowledge that they are maybe creating something valuable to give them a leverage to maybe start a company afterwards? LB: Yes, of course, but it’s not that easy. So patents, you know, are these mysterious things, everybody thinks that are so, you know, you have a patent and then money just comes. It’s not like that. You have to explain to a researcher what is a valuable research result of a great paper and what is a great patent. It’s not necessarily the same. Actually, patents sometimes may need boring data nobody wants to generate. I find that is sort of the most difficult thing to explain. Of course, we do it when when you know researchers come to us to do it, they have a patent . And even then we have to have this conversation. Sometimes it&apos;s difficult. You have fantastic research. But not a good patent. You know? So indeed, if ... If we manage to sort of, you know, just be more present, in research, manage to sort of explain what this means. I think PhDs and postdocs will pick it up quite easily. And they will understand and develop, you know, side by side both the research and their, I would say, possibly industrial or startup career. MH: Yeah, that’s something that we feel at Nucleate that there is relatively little work that needs to be put in when it comes to informing PhD students about the opportunities that are already there. But as you know over these years, it can be quite empowering and transformative for their work. Okay, next question, I’m going to move over to Eleanor with something similar actually. So investors will often tell you that it’s extremely important to start building relationships with them, even before you start thinking about a company or as early as you have a company. And I would like to ask, have you seen this happening enough? Are there enough opportunities for people like you to build relationships with innovators? And do you think that maybe the PhDs should be approaching you more or you? And as an investor, should you be creating more opportunities for researchers as well? Um How do you feel about this interaction? EP: Sure, so I think as the VC we do some proactive outreach to researchers, but it tends to be I would say more at the professor level and interaction with the professor about their expertise and then we might then get on to discuss their own research. So I think for PhDs and postdocs, it’s really valuable to have these initiatives such as Nucleate. I didn’t have any idea what a VC was when I was doing my PhD until I got involved with a student-run organization that was focused on increasing entrepreneurship. And so I think it’s really valuable to have these initiatives that can educate postdocs and PhDs so that they know they need to go out and speak to a VC. I would love to see more people being proactive and coming out to reach out to us. So we’re based in the Life Science Incubator, which is 10 minutes walk from here, and it’s in the middle of the university, Utrecht University Medical Centre, and no one has ever come knocking on our door just to reach out and speak to us. And I would love it if someone did, but no one ever has, so it would be great to . Yeah, exactly. [VCs are not those] scary people that you can&apos;t speak to, so I think it would be great to have more proactive PhDs and postdocs. and more events such as these meetings. MH: Yeah, so would you maybe say that you as a VC maybe need to also make not the full step, but the half step? Yes, I’d say we always come to these kinds of events, so I think that there’s not enough of these events. Compared to UK, in London, like you know every week there’s an event for biotech, and as well in Oxford and Cambridge, and I think there’s very few of them here. And I think … NB: I am quite busy with them. MH: I told you she is the most connected panelist! EP: But I think, I mean more at the kind of the more student level, and so having these kind of more informal things that for students I think is very valuable. I think, yeah, there are a lot more of them actually at the startup stage. But I think that within the academic setting, I think it’s missing. MH: Thank you for sharing. I would have a question for Stéfan now. So in your capacity, you already mentioned working with founders, also students, you mentioned 750, 20 plus scaleup. In my experience, the PhD education didn’t include much of an entrepreneurial aspect. And if I was interested in something, I would have to go searching. Do you also work with universities on the master level, but maybe also for this audience on the PhD level? Do you put in maybe an entrepreneurship course or teach the students more about venture creation? SE: Yes, we do that, and it’s not easy. Actually, it’s almost as hard to get into one course, either graduate school or a master studies, it doesn’t really matter, as to do the entire course itself. So it takes a lot of time. That’s too bad. But in Leiden, we will now do it for every Master and PhD student, so in every track it will be in. So that’s quite a big breakthrough in four years from now . I&apos;m starting conversations also with other universities, and we only focus on life science, and also not for every university, but Utrecht is one of them. As it is my alma-mater, it&apos;s easier. But that that is, I think, really necessary, because I I think most of you, as PhD students, don&apos;t really realize, that if you apply for funding, even if you want to be a basic scientist, so really normal, doing research just for research, you have to describe how the knowledge will be used, the implementation paragraph, as they call it. And so you have to understand how this works. And that&apos;s part of also what I always try to convey, even if you don&apos;t want to be an entrepreneur yourself, It is crucial that you think about, okay, why should we, or the society, fund this research, you know even in order to become a successful scientist yourself. But when you want to be a, potentially you want to found a company, you really should be aware of, well, the entire scala, .... , all the stuff that you need to do. And know how to find the people that can help you. MH: Okay, so you talked about PhD education and also the PhD program. And then I have a final question for Nettie, because she’s seen the culture for some amount of time. And I wonder, did it change the culture? Is it easier to start companies? Are people more courageous now? And what is still missing? NB: Well, maybe it’s funny to tell that after my PhD I joined an MBA. And I wrote my master thesis there, and I think it was in 1998 on spinning out biotech science from academia and science in general. And at that time I was going to all the universities because TTOs, technology transfer offices, weren’t around. Yes, most of them were not there. And then some people, they just said, OK. Our commercialization effort is just some merchandise with cups. So that was really very early, but there was also this was of course at the one end, and there were also others like Twente, which was the earliest in entrepreneurship. At the time, meetings like these were not around that it wouldn’t have happened. And many people also, they were a bit angry of me. So why would you do that? I mean, that’s not ethical, because science is for science. I think we’ve come a long way since then, but we’re still not where we should be. I think education is one important thing, and also creating role models, and making it a normal or regular way to become an entrepreneur, or to be somewhere in the interface between science and business, not just become a professor and have the highest goal to become a professor. I mean, you can do much more with science than just being in research, although it’s all based in research. But I think we’re so lucky to have good brains , all the people here and we meet, they are people with good brains, and who can and employ them for society and well, make it work. MH: That’s a nice note to end on. NB: Well, that’s my main motivation. MH: Well before we leave you, actually, I would like to leave the audience to ask questions. We have time for one or two questions at the moment. So think about it. NB: When you think about it, I still have one thing to mention. We’re looking for people. So if you’re interested in working with us in our office to make the Biotech Booster program work. Reach out to us, or Dorus. MH: Yes. Can you say to whom you would like to address the question? AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think this is more like a general question, so I’m not very sure who I should ask. So is it OK for you to speak naturally– Yeah, I’m from NKI. In my institute, everyone is focused on science problems. So the science problem and the question in industry have a distance, I think. And the problem is how do we form a science question and to solve an industry problem, and which kind of question we should ask, like which kind of problem industry or society really care, and how do we know this question? NB: Yeah. Well, I think all of us play a role there. Yeah. So if you are working in science, maybe you should first go to the TTO. And then the TTO helps you out to participate in the incubator program or in an incubator in another location. Then you come to us for funding and then you go to Eleanor for more funding. It depends on the stage where you are. So I think all of us play a role there. LB: Yeah, so your first step would be the TTO. If you have even just a vague idea of what the specific question to ask would be, but you’re not sure, come to the TTO. That’s what we do on a regular basis, you know, to help people achieve their ideas. And it happens quite often that people come in with examples and technology and they think they only thought about one application. And then there’s another perfect application of that technology, maybe even like some other groups you can work with or a company. And you know that’s what we do. This happens quite often. MH: OK, thanks. In view of time, I will close the discussion now. If there are more questions, now it’s the coffee break. So you can ask them. But before that, give a hand to our panelists.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Solutions for the Dutch Tech</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/06/09/SolutionsForTheDutchTech.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Solutions for the Dutch Tech" /><published>2024-06-09T09:56:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-06-09T09:56:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/06/09/SolutionsForTheDutchTech</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/06/09/SolutionsForTheDutchTech.html">&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/delaunay_formescirculaires.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post we looked at the main challenges highlighted in the State of Dutch Tech report issued by teachleap.nl earlier this year. If you have not read the earlier post yet, you can check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinholub.com/business/startup/2024/05/09/StateOfDutchTech_Problems.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t do that, I applaud you for living by the adage “Rather than trying to change something old, build something new”. You are in the right place and should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinholub.com/subscribe/&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to this blog. However, here we will be talking about fiscal policy (brace for it). This is a slow-moving field and the knowledge of how things are now is therefore important. As a brief summary, the challenges were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Startups glow slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to growth capital is limited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding the right talent is hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the challenges we also highlighted strengths of the ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of strong research institutions, with good patent output.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investors’ seeing the Netherlands as a strong hub for biotech and green tech ventures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geographically decentralized ecosystem of incubation and accelerator programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The BeNeLux being the HQ of number of EU-level institutions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage&quot;&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eif.org/index.htm&quot;&gt;European Investment Fund&lt;/a&gt; in Luxembourg, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will look at how to address these challenges, while acknowledging the existing strengths. But before we do that, let’s give credit where credit is due. Lot of information in this post was put together by teachleap.nl in the State of Dutch Tech report (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techleap.nl/report/state-of-dutch-tech-report-2024/&quot;&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;). Chapeau to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/stateofDutchTech.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;The state of the Dutch tech may not be great, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://techleap.nl/&quot;&gt;techleap.nl&lt;/a&gt; is!&lt;/div&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution-1-aint-nothing-big-money-cant-solve&quot;&gt;Solution 1: Ain’t nothing (big) money can’t solve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch startups generally grow slowly. This is a product of a multitude of factors, both cultural and structural. Both are difficult to fix. Here, let’s focus on the more tangible of the two: the structural factor. One obvious way to encourage more growth is by providing adequate levels of funding. The challenge is that driving growth at this stage does require a substantial amount of capital, and the system must find ways to support this by making this capital structurally available. If this sounds like coordination and some amount of politics, then you are listening right (fiscal politics here we come).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/economic-stimulus-comic.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;Resources for prosperity are available, but it is a matter of allocating them correctly.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The techleap’s report highlights that larger investment rounds into Dutch startups are likely to include foreign capital (75% at 10-100 M level, and 85% at 100M and beyond). This goes to underscore the importance of international cooperation that could mobilize more growth capital. While I second the need for cooperation on international level, I think that this is potentially too-slow, and in any case a barbwire of conflicts of interests (once EU makes capital available to NL, it cannot refuse to do so for other member states). This is probably also while the most recent example of this, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invest-nl.nl/actueel/Invest-NL-en-Europees-Investeringsfonds-lanceren-Dutch-Future-Fund-II&quot;&gt;Dutch Future Fund II&lt;/a&gt; by EIF (European Investment Fund) is relatively modest, with 200 M EUR committed from the EIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seems that this leads to secondary effects and mobilization of more capital, it is unclear how important this effect is. First, I did not find any counterfactual evaluations. Wouldn’t this “secondary”-capital have been invested anyway? Second, this capital is made available progressively, and split among multiple VC funds. Consequently, it seems ill-suited to deal with the problem that needs addressing the most, i.e. making large sums structurally available for growth investments. As per usual, it probably started off with everybody being well-intentioned, but politics got the better side of it, reducing the effectiveness of the final implementation.
Let’s now look at what I believe to be at least equally promising ways to get access to this type of capital. A one the techleap’s report only briefly mentions, by recalling that demissionary minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2023/05/26/startups-en-scale-ups-als-motor-voor-transities-en-groei&quot;&gt;highlighted a gap in the existing system&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, that institutional investors (such as pension funds) seem to be interested in investing in startups and scaleups but lack precedence and framework to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-small-detour-on-a-familiar-subject&quot;&gt;A small detour on a familiar subject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiscal policies, pension funds, and international collaborations may sound all too remote and abstract, so let’s now look at everyone’s favorite subject to complain about, the Dutch housing market crisis. Many expats coming to the Netherlands (me included) will be quite surprised by how “right winged” the situation is when it comes to housing. Historically, this seems to have been treated as people’s problem. There was little regulation on rents, and not enough care given to whether enough, and adequate, housing is being built. The consequences of that are apparent now, with the crisis of the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!---
&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/woningnood_rtl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;… the rest of the text reads “door vluchteling”. I clipped this out as it is not important in this context. What matters is that the current housing crisis is a result of governmental mismanagement. News item from&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5425673/vn-rapporteur-woningnood-slecht-beleid-vluchteling/&quot;&gt;RTL News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A corollary of this issue is that housing is seen as the primary means of investment in the country. I am by no means expert on this, and have much to learn. I do think though, that it is safe to say that real estate investment (at least for one’s primary residence) is the most tax-favorable vehicle there is in the Netherlands. I have a lot of issues with it, but for now let’s keep this to the most pressing one in the context of this article. And that is: it locks up huge amounts of capital. There are 8+ millions of housing units, with an average (and growing) price of 370k EUR [&lt;a href=&quot;https://allecijfers.nl/nederland/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]. These have aggregate value of 8e6*0.37e6=3e12 EUR. That’s 3 trillion, or 3’000 billion EUR.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If even just 10% of this value was redirected into growth investment, it would allow for 3’000 investment rounds @ 100M EUR. According to the State of the Dutch tech report there are ~1’250 startups that received 0.1-10M worth of funding in the whole county. Releasing 300bn EUR from housing could lift this whole ecosystem to series C+ level &lt;em&gt;2.5 times instantly&lt;/em&gt;. This calculation, of course, is extremely simplistic. The purpose of it here is to illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems a good idea to look at whether other countries have figured this out at least a bit better. I previously lived in Switzerland, which has a more regulated housing market. There is lower proportion of house ownership (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/construction-housing/dwellings/housing-conditions/tenants-owners.html&quot;&gt;35%&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://allecijfers.nl/nederland/&quot;&gt;57%&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands), with larger role of (non-profit!) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lebendige-traditionen.ch/tradition/en/home/traditions/housing-cooperatives.html&quot;&gt;housing corporations&lt;/a&gt;. Even in tenant-occupied housing, the rents are regulated much more tightly than in NL (as written before, I find the Dutch setup much too liberal). Rents are, for example, linked to inflation (so are they in NL, but read on), and can increase only by sub percent values above it. When the inflation is negative (i.e. there is deflation), the rents in fact have to drop! The Swiss government does a much better job at recognizing housing as a right, and something that should not be seen as (significant) investment or source of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hitting-at-least-two-birds-with-one-stone-incentivize-vc-able-pension-schemes&quot;&gt;Hitting (at least) two birds with one stone: Incentivize VC-able pension schemes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss, being relatively less able to save and invest by means of real estate ownership, have perks that make up for it. They benefit from low taxation on stock ownership, with corresponding low capital gains tax on their sale. This is really nice, as it allows one to invest the best way an individual investor can these days – passively. With little work you can reap returns that are above the housing market returns AND, save yourself a lot of hassles with house ownership, AND remain more geographically mobile. This all sounds great, but it does have the disadvantage of you mostly shoving your capital into hands of frequently US-based institutional investors, while the capital could have arguably been used locally to drive competitiveness and growth of your own geographical region. By the way, this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pionline.com/article/20170425/INTERACTIVE/170429926/80-of-equity-market-cap-held-by-institutions&quot;&gt;what pension funds mostly do&lt;/a&gt;, and why it is so important to diversify their investments to something with better secondary effects for local economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss have understood this, and implemented an institutionalized system of private pensions plans (PPP) that creates more flexibility in how individual pensions are invested. Dubbed the third pillar, it has two parts. 3a – restricted PPP, and 3b – unrestricted PPP. Both are potential contributors to funding local scale ups, but it is the 3b that is the best cut out for it. These investments lie somewhat between an investment into the stock market and traditional pension funds. They allow individuals to select a risk profile and to some degree allow for channeling pension-directed savings into riskier vehicles such as startup and growth funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make a simple back of the envelope calculation to get a sense for whether this can matter. Assume that half of the Swiss population in their working age (say 25-65) invest in the 3b third pillar, and that they invest 3’000 CHF a year.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Next, assume that they do so for a full 40 years, and that the yearly return on this investment is 4%. For each individual this leads to \(FV = P [((1 + r)^t – 1) / r]\), where P=3’000 r=4%, n=40. Running the numbers, this is 285k CHF.  As there is roughly 4 million people between 25 and 65 in Switzerland (and we assumed half of them invest to pillar 3b), this gives in total 0.285e6 * 2e6 = 6e11, or 600bn CHF. If only 10% of it is allowed to be directed into growth investment in companies, it still would be enough for 600 series C+ with 100 M each. Assuming the Dutch would invest the same way, the amount would be double in the Netherlands (its population being double that of Switzerland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this has been another simplistic calculation, I hope it illustrates the opportunity that lies in the capital that is directed towards pension savings. This case is especially pronounced for the Netherlands, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/721152/total-pension-assets-of-selected-countries-worldwide/&quot;&gt;a top five/six country worldwide&lt;/a&gt; in terms of total assets in pension funds. Leveraging the existing capital in pension funds, as well offering new ways to save for pension, all offer opportunities to channel substantial capital into driving economic growth. It also has the advantage of incentivizing people to save for retirement. If the Dutch government does not explore this way to structurally increase access to growth capital, it is leaving a large opportunity on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/pensionassetsAUM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;Per-country share of assets in the top 300 pension funds globally. Source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkingaheadinstitute.org/content/uploads/2022/09/PI-300-2023-3.pdf&quot;&gt;Thinking Ahead Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The Dutch pension fund capital amounts to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/607698/assets-under-management-by-pension-funds-in-the-netherlands/&quot;&gt;over 3’000 bn EUR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money invested in retirement savings is the most substantial source of capital in this context. There is one more investment vehicle that has been successfully explored (in the UK,) and is currently being implemented in other countries in Europe (Germany, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sifted.eu/articles/france-uk-for-boosting-business-angels&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;). Most recently, France is implementing policies that allow individuals to gain a tax break of 30%, or even 50%, on pre-seed and seed investments into startups (up to 100 and 150k EUR]. Similar schemes exist for a number of years in the UK, where they contributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://eisa.org.uk/about-eis/facts-and-figures/&quot;&gt;2.1bn GBP of early stage funding in 2022/3&lt;/a&gt;. While this is not evaluated at the counterfactual (i.e. how many of these investors would have invested anyway), it seems to provide a reasonable amount of incentive and a policy other countries should seek to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the pension-redirection system we described above, where diversified investments are made from a large pool of money with long time horizons, here the risk profile is much higher, and shouldered entirely by the individual. This is why it will remain reserved to modest total capital, and interesting only for high net-worth individuals (or gamblers). If implemented in the NL, it would be a move in the right direction, as it would encourage high-worth individuals to explore investments with more positive secondary effects for the economy, rather than passively investing into stocks, or locking up capital in housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution-2-promote-academic-entrepreneurship&quot;&gt;Solution 2: Promote academic entrepreneurship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has a strong ecosystem of universities and research centers with good academic output. It is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/scientific-publications-per-million?tab=table&quot;&gt;the top 10&lt;/a&gt; countries worldwide by academic output, and does particularly well in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/nature-index/country-outputs/generate/health-sciences/global&quot;&gt;health sciences&lt;/a&gt;. So far so good. However, the translation of the innovation into value is sluggish. Seven out of every eight patents filed in the Netherlands never turn into a company. The rate is as bad as 1 in 10 for universities and it improves somewhat to 1 in 6 for university medical centers (UMCs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in the country, I see that there is a good number of institutions and organizations that target prospective entrepreneurs and early stage founders. From incubators, to accelerators, to funders. I think there are two reasons why this support network does not translate to (better) results. First, many of the entrepreneurship-encouraging activities are fairly new, and their impact will take more time to materialize. Second, entrepreneurship is not seen as an attractive career choice by the vast majority of academics. This hampers deeptech venture creation. Such a situation is in contrast to the US, where many students join a top-notch scientific lab already with the intention to start a company, and are supported by their PI in doing so.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is generally pretty heavy on work-life balance, and the Dutch are certainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/netherlands/&quot;&gt;one of the champions in that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Starting a company has an image of hustling on something that is probably not going to work. Try to motivate yourself to do that while your friends are landing permanent contracts in-between their frequent trips to Intratuin and IKEA to equip their newly bought homes. Handling peer pressure in this context is challenging but for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinholub.com/business/startup/2024/01/22/PmarcaAdviceForFounders.html&quot;&gt;the most determined founders&lt;/a&gt;.
The culture needs to change. Founding a company should be seen as something fulfilling both professionally and personally, with a potential for large upside on the impact and income level. Perpetuating the image of a lonely founder without work-life balance is not useful. The goal is not to paint a rosy picture, simply a more realistic one. For every founder who hustles with no work balance there will be others who pull it off while keeping functional relationships and high life satisfaction through most of it. It is important to create a more representative and living image of what founding means in any given field, time, and locale. A simple and powerful way to do it is to create more opportunities for interaction between early stage founders and academic trainees. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eth-entrepreneurship_entrepreneurial-backpack-series-activity-7166805463534125057-1LTL?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;This is happening&lt;/a&gt; in some areas, but needs to become more common. While doing so, it will be important to keep diversity and inclusion in mind, as well as account for survivorship bias by inviting a diverse pool of founders, including those whose ventures failed.  I recently joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nucleate.org/&quot;&gt;Nucleate&lt;/a&gt; where we are helping to create this type of interface. It was one of my main motivations to start a branch in the Netherlands, as I personally felt the lack of these interactions. Another reason was to change the academic experience of PhDs and postdocs, which I turn to next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 4+ years I was at the university as a PhD, the only business I heard of was the one in “business as usual” and “minding your own business”. On the other hand, I was asked to do coursework for 45 Graduate School (GS) credits, amounting to 540 hours of workload. I don’t assume any ill intent, but that does hinder me from calling the courses by their right name: a waste of time. Save a few small exceptions, that’s what the majority of them were.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The only “upside” of such a system was that it allowed me to get some of my work-related activities recognized towards these credits (such as organizing a panel at the iGEM Jamboree in 2023), and that I could scrape some credits by doing MOOCs from other universities. Calling this an upside is an overstatement. I would have done these activities anyway. The net value of the whole GS is in red numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, there is a framework that has PhDs put in 500+ hours (that is 3 months of full time work!) towards something. Now we just need to make this something useful. There is some good precedence available elsewhere (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/learn/biotechnology/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-the-science-and-business-of-biotechnology&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.nyu.edu/research/technology-opportunities-ventures/sites/default/files/biomedical-entrepreneurship-program-fall-course.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I am personally interested in updating and adapting it to the local ecosystem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nucleate.org/&quot;&gt;Nucleate&lt;/a&gt; is an organization that has capacity to do this, and we are looking for partners within universities and institutional partners to make this happen. Please get in touch if you would like to learn more or contribute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution-3-grow-attract-and-retain-talent&quot;&gt;Solution 3: Grow, attract and retain talent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands struggles with talent shortages, and it is not doing well in addressing them from neither the &lt;a href=&quot;https://advalvas.vu.nl/en/science-education/netherlands-spends-less-stem-other-countries/&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt;, nor the &lt;a href=&quot;https://expatax.nl/the-30-ruling-in-2024-what-has-changed/&quot;&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; talent pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/jobvacancyrates.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;Job vacancy rate in the EU. The higher the rate the longer it takes to fill a job vacancy. Source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/09/26/working-in-europe-which-countries-have-the-most-job-vacancies-and-what-roles-are-in-high-d&quot;&gt;Euronews &amp;amp; Eurostat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the local level, the country must promote STEM fields as attractive areas of study. The Netherlands sees &lt;strong&gt;only 19% of its university students graduate from STEM&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s only about half that of Germany. It also &lt;a href=&quot;https://advalvas.vu.nl/en/science-education/netherlands-spends-less-stem-other-countries/&quot;&gt;underfunds&lt;/a&gt; this area relative to other countries. Next to universities, the country also must promote these subjects at schools of applied sciences, and foster the creation of more technical apprenticeships. Local and national governments should work with businesses to leverage this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn to the global level now. The Netherlands does courtesy to its name (low-lands) and culture (&lt;em&gt;doe normaal&lt;/em&gt;) – it does not stand as a location for global talent. It’s by all means a fair country, with a good balance across a number of aspects. It is well connected between its individual cities and internationally. It affords a good tradeoff between family life and career opportunities. It is easy to settle in, as everyone speaks good English, and there are a lot of expats already. It has good educational institutions and is very safe. Even the weather is not that bad, and summers are generally quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this description is that similar things could be said about a number of other countries, leaving the Netherlands somewhere in the middle of the pack of “good” countries where to live (say in the top 20 or so, depending what factors matter to you). If the Dutch are serious about doing better than this, they must acknowledge that the competition for talent is fierce, and take adequate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle for talent starts early, and so it is important to enter it early. This is why English taught bachelors are likely net-positive, and something the Dutch would have done better by not doing anything about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/04/universities-to-offer-more-dutch-taught-degree-courses-from-2025/&quot;&gt;instead of scaling them down&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The battle for talent is probably the most rampant at the master level. I have long been a critic of charging some students (much) more for their degree. If you come from non-EU/EFTA, you will pay about 25k EUR per year for your masters in the Netherlands, 10-fold more than students from the EU/EFTA countries! Talent seems to be valued only as long as it has very deep pockets or a pedigree. This obscenity continues on PhD level, where PhDs arriving on foreign scholarships will not see the level of their reimbursement matched up to a university (and country)-wide standard. EPFL, as an example, does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/doctoral-studies-structure/doctoral-students-salary/&quot;&gt;implement this matching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, many countries either historically had (US, UK, …), or recently decided to create (Germany, Switzerland), opportunities for pursuing doctorate without masters (so called direct doctorate), which continue to be lacking in the Netherlands. Whatever the intent of this messaging is, the results are quite clear. If dealt with the opportunity to do so, students across bachelor, master and PhD level, are likely to pursue their studies and careers elsewhere. Consequently, the country is missing out on some of the best talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle for talent continues after graduation. To attract skilled employees, it is important to offer adequate compensation through salary, and especially in the early-stage, through equity. Aside from directly increasing starter salaries (which is in my opinion badly needed), the Netherlands has historically implemented a 30% ruling that shielded expats from some degree of taxation, effectively bumping up their salaries. Initially available for eight years, it has been cut to five, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://expatax.nl/the-30-ruling-in-2024-what-has-changed/&quot;&gt;most recently scaled down substantially more&lt;/a&gt;. The scaling back also includes removal of partial foreign tax liability, which massively reduces the attractiveness of the country for expats. I, for one, would have probably not come to the Netherlands to do a PhD if these changes happened a couple of years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the 30% ruling, which the government would have done the best not to touch (too late!), improving employee compensation through equity is in need of reform. The way stocks are distributed to company employees, and taxed, in the Netherlands, is unattractive. Number of other countries implement ESOPs (employee stock ownership programs) do a much better job in this aspect. The Netherlands must adopt similar policies, otherwise it will continue to be unattractive for those who seek to use their talent where it has the largest leverage - in early stage companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this should have been post about solutions, and I admit to have been complaining a lot (that’s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@k.kozmana/ice-cold-slightly-crazy-98ee875f078a&quot;&gt;growing up in communist country does to you&lt;/a&gt;! To end on the correct note, the solutions we discussed in this section are: 1) channel more funding into STEM degrees and increase the number of students therein, 2) increase the number of technical apprenticeships 3) retain English-taught bachelors or even scale them up, 4) abandon high-tranche tuition fees for non-EU/EFTA nationals, 5) match-up PhD scholarships up to a standard level, 6) create options for direct doctorate, 7) increase salaries, 8) retain 30% ruling, and 9) reform ESOP taxation to make equity ownership in early stage companies more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/tangledsolutions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;Listing the solutions was the easy part, now to implement them …&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that there are a number of solutions available to address shortcomings in the current tech entrepreneurial landscape in the Netherlands. Few are as simple as not changing the good things, or re-implementing measures that were scaled back. Many, however, do require large scale coordinated political action. I am optimistic about the Dutch political leadership eventually figuring out what the right thing to do is, and doing it. I am however NOT optimistic about how long this is going to take. Consequently, I expect the Netherlands to struggle keeping its position as an attractive destination for expat talent among competition. Netherlands-based individuals should be focusing on the things they can control. Working with universities, researchers and recent graduates to create dialogues around entrepreneurship, building cross-border networks to facilitate exchange of talent and capital, and creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.octant.bio/blog-posts/open-sourcing-the-octant-apprenticeship&quot;&gt;in-house apprenticeship programs&lt;/a&gt; to foster talent internally are all examples of actions with potential for large positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

You are in the right place and should subscribe to this blog. However, here we will be talking about fiscal policy (brace for it). This is a slow-moving field and the knowledge of how things are now is therefore important. As a brief summary, the challenges were: Startups glow slowly. Access to growth capital is limited. Finding the right talent is hard. Aside from the challenges we also highlighted strengths of the ecosystem: Number of strong research institutions, with good patent output. Investors’ seeing the Netherlands as a strong hub for biotech and green tech ventures. Geographically decentralized ecosystem of incubation and accelerator programs. The BeNeLux being the HQ of number of EU-level institutions (European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, European Investment Fund in Luxembourg, …) In this post, we will look at how to address these challenges, while acknowledging the existing strengths. But before we do that, let’s give credit where credit is due. Lot of information in this post was put together by teachleap.nl in the State of Dutch Tech report (download here). Chapeau to them! Solution 1: Ain’t nothing (big) money can’t solve Dutch startups generally grow slowly. This is a product of a multitude of factors, both cultural and structural. Both are difficult to fix. Here, let’s focus on the more tangible of the two: the structural factor. One obvious way to encourage more growth is by providing adequate levels of funding. The challenge is that driving growth at this stage does require a substantial amount of capital, and the system must find ways to support this by making this capital structurally available. If this sounds like coordination and some amount of politics, then you are listening right (fiscal politics here we come). Resources for prosperity are available, but it is a matter of allocating them correctly. The techleap’s report highlights that larger investment rounds into Dutch startups are likely to include foreign capital (75% at 10-100 M level, and 85% at 100M and beyond). This goes to underscore the importance of international cooperation that could mobilize more growth capital. While I second the need for cooperation on international level, I think that this is potentially too-slow, and in any case a barbwire of conflicts of interests (once EU makes capital available to NL, it cannot refuse to do so for other member states). This is probably also while the most recent example of this, the Dutch Future Fund II by EIF (European Investment Fund) is relatively modest, with 200 M EUR committed from the EIF. While it seems that this leads to secondary effects and mobilization of more capital, it is unclear how important this effect is. First, I did not find any counterfactual evaluations. Wouldn’t this “secondary”-capital have been invested anyway? Second, this capital is made available progressively, and split among multiple VC funds. Consequently, it seems ill-suited to deal with the problem that needs addressing the most, i.e. making large sums structurally available for growth investments. As per usual, it probably started off with everybody being well-intentioned, but politics got the better side of it, reducing the effectiveness of the final implementation. Let’s now look at what I believe to be at least equally promising ways to get access to this type of capital. A one the techleap’s report only briefly mentions, by recalling that demissionary minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK) highlighted a gap in the existing system. Namely, that institutional investors (such as pension funds) seem to be interested in investing in startups and scaleups but lack precedence and framework to do so. A small detour on a familiar subject Fiscal policies, pension funds, and international collaborations may sound all too remote and abstract, so let’s now look at everyone’s favorite subject to complain about, the Dutch housing market crisis. Many expats coming to the Netherlands (me included) will be quite surprised by how “right winged” the situation is when it comes to housing. Historically, this seems to have been treated as people’s problem. There was little regulation on rents, and not enough care given to whether enough, and adequate, housing is being built. The consequences of that are apparent now, with the crisis of the housing market. A corollary of this issue is that housing is seen as the primary means of investment in the country. I am by no means expert on this, and have much to learn. I do think though, that it is safe to say that real estate investment (at least for one’s primary residence) is the most tax-favorable vehicle there is in the Netherlands. I have a lot of issues with it, but for now let’s keep this to the most pressing one in the context of this article. And that is: it locks up huge amounts of capital. There are 8+ millions of housing units, with an average (and growing) price of 370k EUR [source]. These have aggregate value of 8e6*0.37e6=3e12 EUR. That’s 3 trillion, or 3’000 billion EUR.1 If even just 10% of this value was redirected into growth investment, it would allow for 3’000 investment rounds @ 100M EUR. According to the State of the Dutch tech report there are ~1’250 startups that received 0.1-10M worth of funding in the whole county. Releasing 300bn EUR from housing could lift this whole ecosystem to series C+ level 2.5 times instantly. This calculation, of course, is extremely simplistic. The purpose of it here is to illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity. It seems a good idea to look at whether other countries have figured this out at least a bit better. I previously lived in Switzerland, which has a more regulated housing market. There is lower proportion of house ownership (35% compared to 57% in the Netherlands), with larger role of (non-profit!) housing corporations. Even in tenant-occupied housing, the rents are regulated much more tightly than in NL (as written before, I find the Dutch setup much too liberal). Rents are, for example, linked to inflation (so are they in NL, but read on), and can increase only by sub percent values above it. When the inflation is negative (i.e. there is deflation), the rents in fact have to drop! The Swiss government does a much better job at recognizing housing as a right, and something that should not be seen as (significant) investment or source of income. Hitting (at least) two birds with one stone: Incentivize VC-able pension schemes The Swiss, being relatively less able to save and invest by means of real estate ownership, have perks that make up for it. They benefit from low taxation on stock ownership, with corresponding low capital gains tax on their sale. This is really nice, as it allows one to invest the best way an individual investor can these days – passively. With little work you can reap returns that are above the housing market returns AND, save yourself a lot of hassles with house ownership, AND remain more geographically mobile. This all sounds great, but it does have the disadvantage of you mostly shoving your capital into hands of frequently US-based institutional investors, while the capital could have arguably been used locally to drive competitiveness and growth of your own geographical region. By the way, this is what pension funds mostly do, and why it is so important to diversify their investments to something with better secondary effects for local economies. The Swiss have understood this, and implemented an institutionalized system of private pensions plans (PPP) that creates more flexibility in how individual pensions are invested. Dubbed the third pillar, it has two parts. 3a – restricted PPP, and 3b – unrestricted PPP. Both are potential contributors to funding local scale ups, but it is the 3b that is the best cut out for it. These investments lie somewhat between an investment into the stock market and traditional pension funds. They allow individuals to select a risk profile and to some degree allow for channeling pension-directed savings into riskier vehicles such as startup and growth funding. Let’s make a simple back of the envelope calculation to get a sense for whether this can matter. Assume that half of the Swiss population in their working age (say 25-65) invest in the 3b third pillar, and that they invest 3’000 CHF a year.2 Next, assume that they do so for a full 40 years, and that the yearly return on this investment is 4%. For each individual this leads to \(FV = P [((1 + r)^t – 1) / r]\), where P=3’000 r=4%, n=40. Running the numbers, this is 285k CHF. As there is roughly 4 million people between 25 and 65 in Switzerland (and we assumed half of them invest to pillar 3b), this gives in total 0.285e6 * 2e6 = 6e11, or 600bn CHF. If only 10% of it is allowed to be directed into growth investment in companies, it still would be enough for 600 series C+ with 100 M each. Assuming the Dutch would invest the same way, the amount would be double in the Netherlands (its population being double that of Switzerland). While this has been another simplistic calculation, I hope it illustrates the opportunity that lies in the capital that is directed towards pension savings. This case is especially pronounced for the Netherlands, which is a top five/six country worldwide in terms of total assets in pension funds. Leveraging the existing capital in pension funds, as well offering new ways to save for pension, all offer opportunities to channel substantial capital into driving economic growth. It also has the advantage of incentivizing people to save for retirement. If the Dutch government does not explore this way to structurally increase access to growth capital, it is leaving a large opportunity on the table. Per-country share of assets in the top 300 pension funds globally. Source Thinking Ahead Institute. The Dutch pension fund capital amounts to over 3’000 bn EUR. The money invested in retirement savings is the most substantial source of capital in this context. There is one more investment vehicle that has been successfully explored (in the UK,) and is currently being implemented in other countries in Europe (Germany, and France). Most recently, France is implementing policies that allow individuals to gain a tax break of 30%, or even 50%, on pre-seed and seed investments into startups (up to 100 and 150k EUR]. Similar schemes exist for a number of years in the UK, where they contributed 2.1bn GBP of early stage funding in 2022/3. While this is not evaluated at the counterfactual (i.e. how many of these investors would have invested anyway), it seems to provide a reasonable amount of incentive and a policy other countries should seek to adopt. Compared to the pension-redirection system we described above, where diversified investments are made from a large pool of money with long time horizons, here the risk profile is much higher, and shouldered entirely by the individual. This is why it will remain reserved to modest total capital, and interesting only for high net-worth individuals (or gamblers). If implemented in the NL, it would be a move in the right direction, as it would encourage high-worth individuals to explore investments with more positive secondary effects for the economy, rather than passively investing into stocks, or locking up capital in housing. Solution 2: Promote academic entrepreneurship The Netherlands has a strong ecosystem of universities and research centers with good academic output. It is in the top 10 countries worldwide by academic output, and does particularly well in health sciences. So far so good. However, the translation of the innovation into value is sluggish. Seven out of every eight patents filed in the Netherlands never turn into a company. The rate is as bad as 1 in 10 for universities and it improves somewhat to 1 in 6 for university medical centers (UMCs). Living in the country, I see that there is a good number of institutions and organizations that target prospective entrepreneurs and early stage founders. From incubators, to accelerators, to funders. I think there are two reasons why this support network does not translate to (better) results. First, many of the entrepreneurship-encouraging activities are fairly new, and their impact will take more time to materialize. Second, entrepreneurship is not seen as an attractive career choice by the vast majority of academics. This hampers deeptech venture creation. Such a situation is in contrast to the US, where many students join a top-notch scientific lab already with the intention to start a company, and are supported by their PI in doing so.3 Europe is generally pretty heavy on work-life balance, and the Dutch are certainly one of the champions in that.4 Starting a company has an image of hustling on something that is probably not going to work. Try to motivate yourself to do that while your friends are landing permanent contracts in-between their frequent trips to Intratuin and IKEA to equip their newly bought homes. Handling peer pressure in this context is challenging but for the most determined founders. The culture needs to change. Founding a company should be seen as something fulfilling both professionally and personally, with a potential for large upside on the impact and income level. Perpetuating the image of a lonely founder without work-life balance is not useful. The goal is not to paint a rosy picture, simply a more realistic one. For every founder who hustles with no work balance there will be others who pull it off while keeping functional relationships and high life satisfaction through most of it. It is important to create a more representative and living image of what founding means in any given field, time, and locale. A simple and powerful way to do it is to create more opportunities for interaction between early stage founders and academic trainees. This is happening in some areas, but needs to become more common. While doing so, it will be important to keep diversity and inclusion in mind, as well as account for survivorship bias by inviting a diverse pool of founders, including those whose ventures failed. I recently joined Nucleate where we are helping to create this type of interface. It was one of my main motivations to start a branch in the Netherlands, as I personally felt the lack of these interactions. Another reason was to change the academic experience of PhDs and postdocs, which I turn to next. Throughout the 4+ years I was at the university as a PhD, the only business I heard of was the one in “business as usual” and “minding your own business”. On the other hand, I was asked to do coursework for 45 Graduate School (GS) credits, amounting to 540 hours of workload. I don’t assume any ill intent, but that does hinder me from calling the courses by their right name: a waste of time. Save a few small exceptions, that’s what the majority of them were.5 The only “upside” of such a system was that it allowed me to get some of my work-related activities recognized towards these credits (such as organizing a panel at the iGEM Jamboree in 2023), and that I could scrape some credits by doing MOOCs from other universities. Calling this an upside is an overstatement. I would have done these activities anyway. The net value of the whole GS is in red numbers. The good news is, there is a framework that has PhDs put in 500+ hours (that is 3 months of full time work!) towards something. Now we just need to make this something useful. There is some good precedence available elsewhere (e.g. here, and here, and I am personally interested in updating and adapting it to the local ecosystem. Nucleate is an organization that has capacity to do this, and we are looking for partners within universities and institutional partners to make this happen.

Solution 3: Grow, attract and retain talent The Netherlands struggles with talent shortages, and it is not doing well in addressing them from neither the local, nor the global talent pools. Job vacancy rate in the EU. The higher the rate the longer it takes to fill a job vacancy. Source Euronews &amp;amp; Eurostat. On the local level, the country must promote STEM fields as attractive areas of study. The Netherlands sees only 19% of its university students graduate from STEM. That’s only about half that of Germany. It also underfunds this area relative to other countries. Next to universities, the country also must promote these subjects at schools of applied sciences, and foster the creation of more technical apprenticeships. Local and national governments should work with businesses to leverage this opportunity. Let’s turn to the global level now. The Netherlands does courtesy to its name (low-lands) and culture (doe normaal) – it does not stand as a location for global talent. It’s by all means a fair country, with a good balance across a number of aspects. It is well connected between its individual cities and internationally. It affords a good tradeoff between family life and career opportunities. It is easy to settle in, as everyone speaks good English, and there are a lot of expats already. It has good educational institutions and is very safe. Even the weather is not that bad, and summers are generally quite nice. The problem with this description is that similar things could be said about a number of other countries, leaving the Netherlands somewhere in the middle of the pack of “good” countries where to live (say in the top 20 or so, depending what factors matter to you). If the Dutch are serious about doing better than this, they must acknowledge that the competition for talent is fierce, and take adequate action. The battle for talent starts early, and so it is important to enter it early. This is why English taught bachelors are likely net-positive, and something the Dutch would have done better by not doing anything about, instead of scaling them down).6 The battle for talent is probably the most rampant at the master level. I have long been a critic of charging some students (much) more for their degree. If you come from non-EU/EFTA, you will pay about 25k EUR per year for your masters in the Netherlands, 10-fold more than students from the EU/EFTA countries! Talent seems to be valued only as long as it has very deep pockets or a pedigree. This obscenity continues on PhD level, where PhDs arriving on foreign scholarships will not see the level of their reimbursement matched up to a university (and country)-wide standard. EPFL, as an example, does implement this matching. Finally, many countries either historically had (US, UK, …), or recently decided to create (Germany, Switzerland), opportunities for pursuing doctorate without masters (so called direct doctorate), which continue to be lacking in the Netherlands. Whatever the intent of this messaging is, the results are quite clear. If dealt with the opportunity to do so, students across bachelor, master and PhD level, are likely to pursue their studies and careers elsewhere. Consequently, the country is missing out on some of the best talent. The battle for talent continues after graduation. To attract skilled employees, it is important to offer adequate compensation through salary, and especially in the early-stage, through equity. Aside from directly increasing starter salaries (which is in my opinion badly needed), the Netherlands has historically implemented a 30% ruling that shielded expats from some degree of taxation, effectively bumping up their salaries. Initially available for eight years, it has been cut to five, and most recently scaled down substantially more. The scaling back also includes removal of partial foreign tax liability, which massively reduces the attractiveness of the country for expats. I, for one, would have probably not come to the Netherlands to do a PhD if these changes happened a couple of years earlier. Unlike the 30% ruling, which the government would have done the best not to touch (too late!), improving employee compensation through equity is in need of reform. The way stocks are distributed to company employees, and taxed, in the Netherlands, is unattractive. Number of other countries implement ESOPs (employee stock ownership programs) do a much better job in this aspect. The Netherlands must adopt similar policies, otherwise it will continue to be unattractive for those who seek to use their talent where it has the largest leverage - in early stage companies. Ok, this should have been post about solutions, and I admit to have been complaining a lot (that’s what growing up in communist country does to you! To end on the correct note, the solutions we discussed in this section are: 1) channel more funding into STEM degrees and increase the number of students therein, 2) increase the number of technical apprenticeships 3) retain English-taught bachelors or even scale them up, 4) abandon high-tranche tuition fees for non-EU/EFTA nationals, 5) match-up PhD scholarships up to a standard level, 6) create options for direct doctorate, 7) increase salaries, 8) retain 30% ruling, and 9) reform ESOP taxation to make equity ownership in early stage companies more attractive. Listing the solutions was the easy part, now to implement them … Conclusions We have seen that there are a number of solutions available to address shortcomings in the current tech entrepreneurial landscape in the Netherlands. Few are as simple as not changing the good things, or re-implementing measures that were scaled back. Many, however, do require large scale coordinated political action. I am optimistic about the Dutch political leadership eventually figuring out what the right thing to do is, and doing it. I am however NOT optimistic about how long this is going to take. Consequently, I expect the Netherlands to struggle keeping its position as an attractive destination for expat talent among competition. Netherlands-based individuals should be focusing on the things they can control. Working with universities, researchers and recent graduates to create dialogues around entrepreneurship, building cross-border networks to facilitate exchange of talent and capital, and creating in-house apprenticeship programs to foster talent internally are all examples of actions with potential for large positive impact.

The point rather being that something like that is possible. &amp;#8617; As an example Carolyn Bertozzi mentions this in this BIOS podcast interview. &amp;#8617; It seems that the Dutch have fallen back in this metric somewhat.

The Dutch cannot afford not having international students.” I guess someone did not get the memo. &amp;#8617;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">State of Dutch Tech 2024, Three Problems</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/05/09/StateOfDutchTech_Problems.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="State of Dutch Tech 2024, Three Problems" /><published>2024-05-09T09:56:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-05-09T09:56:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/05/09/StateOfDutchTech_Problems</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/05/09/StateOfDutchTech_Problems.html">&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/theblacksquare.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking about starting a company in the Netherlands? Or are you already a founder with the dream to upend industries? Or maybe you are dreaming of a job in a high-growth company while biking along the endless canals on the weekends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, and probably a number of more, you should check the State of Dutch Tech report by teachleap.nl (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techleap.nl/report/state-of-dutch-tech-report-2024/&quot;&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;). In this post, I will highlight three major problems it points to. In an upcoming post I will look at three solutions it suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: I want to give chapeau to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techleap.nl/who-we-are/&quot;&gt;techleap.nl&lt;/a&gt; (no affiliation). They are doing great work to continuously evaluate and accelerate the tech-ecosystem in the Netherlands. The report is detailed, yet readable. Well done! Now, for the summary, because, as you may have guessed, acceleration is badly needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/stateofDutchTech.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;The state of the Dutch tech may not be great, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://techleap.nl/&quot;&gt;techleap.nl&lt;/a&gt; is!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-1-dutch-startups-fail-to-grow&quot;&gt;Problem 1: Dutch startups fail to grow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups are great, but they are not very profitable. It is only as companies grow and expand their market share and customer base that they generate attractive returns for their founders and investors. It is also these companies that create substantial employment and give their employees a chance to acquire skills and experience needed to found another high-growth company in the future. So yes, sure startups are great, but you know what is even better? Startups that grow. Unfortunately, the Dutch startups don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some sobering stats from the report: &lt;strong&gt;more than 70% of all Dutch startups will never exit the seed stage&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;only 19% of them will ever receive more than 10M EUR in funding&lt;/strong&gt;. The Dutch are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/patent-applications-per-million&quot;&gt;not a champion in generating patents&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spinout.fyi/blog/data-launch-v2&quot;&gt;turning patents into research-based startups&lt;/a&gt; (spin-offs). Even if formed, these spin-offs don’t grow either. Nearly &lt;strong&gt;50% of Dutch spin-off companies that survive 15 years have less than 10 employees&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;only 18% have above 50&lt;/strong&gt;. After these 15 years, 60% of spin-offs were still privately held. Dreaming of impacting the world with application of your research? Then you may have to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/stateofDutchTech_noofemployees.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, chances of you making it big as a founder in the Netherlands are relatively slim. As it turns out, even if you are one of the lucky ones who gets to grow, it will be &lt;strong&gt;slow&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Median time to reach series A in the Netherlands (4 years) is double that of the US&lt;/strong&gt;. The time to reach series C is 8 years, which is 3 and 2 years longer than in the US and EU respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-2-big-money-is-hard-to-get-in-nl&quot;&gt;Problem 2: Big money is hard to get (in NL)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not any news that European VC funding is lagging the US one. The EU’s per capita VC investment is one eighth of that in the US and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/singapore-vc-funding-per-capita-2023&quot;&gt;the Netherlands is not an outlier&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://stateofeuropeantech.com/reading-tracks/soet-in-5-minutes#C0-0-new-startup-formation&quot;&gt;getting better&lt;/a&gt;, but only very slowly. Additionally, 2023 was not an easy year, with VC funding experiencing a drop of 36% and 38% in the EU and US respectively. Many VCs report LPs delaying or reducing investments. Consequently, the Dutch and European VCs are cautious. That’s exactly the opposite of what Europe needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/stateofDutchTech_reluctantvc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Header&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;VCs are experiencing difficulties sourcing capital from LPs. Taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://techleap.nl/report/state-of-dutch-tech-report-2024/&quot;&gt;State of Dutch Tech 2024 &lt;/a&gt; report.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has several consequences. First, scarcity of capital makes it yet harder for companies to scale. Second, it creates more opportunities for foreign, non-European (e.g. US or Chinese), capital to enter the picture. While this is not immediately a bad thing, it does mean that part of the value created by successful companies will be captured outside of Europe, only exacerbating the problem in the future. In fact, between 2019 and 2023, 85% of all growth equity in the Netherlands included a foreign investment already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While big money is never easy to get, it is harder in the Netherlands than some other places in Europe and certainly much harder than it is in the US. &lt;strong&gt;In the Netherlands, only 1.3% companies raised 100+M EUR investments&lt;/strong&gt;, whereas this is 2.8% in Germany, 2.1% in Switzerland and 1.9% in the UK. Maybe the lack of big money in the Netherlands should not be a surprise given that the phrase “going Dutch” has been around since the 17th century?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-3-the-netherlands-is-not-a-top-destination-for-global-talent&quot;&gt;Problem 3: The Netherlands is not a top destination for global talent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has high salaries, the UK has a global metropolis and the comfort of an English-speaking country, Ireland has low taxes, Switzerland has high salaries, low taxes, and the Alps. The Netherlands has … weed? rain? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.nl/en/insights-and-publications/tax-news/income/box-3-compensation-until-2024--new-system-from-2025.html&quot;&gt;tax policies that violate the European Convention on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;? While I hate to admit it, the Netherlands is simply not a top destination for foreign talent. Don’t get me wrong, it is a fair country, but in comparison to its competition it does not stand out (something the Dutch would probably be happy about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the natural conditions are difficult to change. But that only means that the Dutch must work harder on other fronts to become attractive for recruits from abroad. Unfortunately, they have been doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://expatax.nl/the-30-ruling-in-2024-what-has-changed/&quot;&gt;exactly the opposite&lt;/a&gt;. Some would argue that lack of foreign talent can be substituted with the local one. While this is true, it is so only to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/reinventing-the-european-economy-from-within&quot;&gt;a rather small extent&lt;/a&gt;. It would also still require stable and high-quality governance. What part about the illegal taxation or inability to stimulate growth funding made you think it would be the case? Indeed, it is not. The Netherlands sees &lt;strong&gt;only 19% of its students graduate from STEM fields&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s only about half (!) that of Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to motivate both local and foreign talent to go work for an early-stage company is to promise a chance of becoming (somewhat) wealthy through equity. Unsurprisingly, the Netherlands does not make this easy either. It implements unfavourable taxation schemes and regulations, lacking behind countries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/24/france-wants-to-boost-angel-investment-by-copying-uks-investment-schemes/&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sifted.eu/articles/germany-startup-esop-rule-changes&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, UK and the US in the attractiveness of stock ownership plans (ranking only 14th out of 24 evaluated countries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all this together, it is not a surprise that the Netherlands is one of the three countries in Europe where it takes the longest to fill a job vacancy. Coming full circle, this problem becomes yet more pronounced at senior positions that require substantial expertise and adequate compensation, further slowing down company growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I painted a dark picture. It is a realistic one and I want you to hang it in your living room. Preferably only symbolically, unless you actually have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiart.org/en/kazimir-malevich/black-square-1915&quot;&gt;The Black Square&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/empower-dutch-leadership-support-our-journey-to-the-2024-al&quot;&gt;buying me a coffee or two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this tirade, and the reminder that you too missed the chance of becoming fairy-tale wealthy by painting single-coloured squares, we deserve at least some encouragement. Luckily, there are a handful of good aspects that the report brings forward that we can hang onto. In particular if you are in the biotech industry. One, &lt;strong&gt;29%&lt;/strong&gt; of VC funding in the Netherlands goes to health-related startups, &lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt; goes to food. Both are about &lt;strong&gt;double the European average&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;11%&lt;/strong&gt; goes to semiconductor industry, and that’s &lt;strong&gt;5-fold the European average&lt;/strong&gt;. Two, the Dutch health, pharma and biotech sectors collected over 1B EUR funding between 2019 and 2023. Three, &lt;strong&gt;only 1 out of 8 patents filed by Dutch research institutions are turned into startups&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that there is a large untapped potential for research-based venture creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of Dutch tech is, overall, quite gloomy. But given that you are reading this, you are probably an uncorrectable optimist or even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html&quot;&gt;techno-optimist&lt;/a&gt;. You may also be a prospective founder. As such, where others see a problem, you see a challenge. And where there is a challenge, there may be a solution. Good for you, because this is exactly the angle we will take in the next article, where we discuss three main recommendations for improvement that the report brings forward.

One cannot help but wonder, did Kazimir Malevich have a premonition about the state of Dutch tech in 2024? Original photo from independent.co.uk. Introduction Are you thinking about starting a company in the Netherlands? Or are you already a founder with the dream to upend industries? Or maybe you are dreaming of a job in a high-growth company while biking along the endless canals on the weekends? In all these cases, and probably a number of more, you should check the State of Dutch Tech report by teachleap.nl (download here). In this post, I will highlight three major problems it points to. In an upcoming post I will look at three solutions it suggests. First things first: I want to give chapeau to techleap.nl (no affiliation). They are doing great work to continuously evaluate and accelerate the tech-ecosystem in the Netherlands. The report is detailed, yet readable. Well done! Now, for the summary, because, as you may have guessed, acceleration is badly needed. The state of the Dutch tech may not be great, but techleap.nl is! Problem 1: Dutch startups fail to grow Startups are great, but they are not very profitable. It is only as companies grow and expand their market share and customer base that they generate attractive returns for their founders and investors. It is also these companies that create substantial employment and give their employees a chance to acquire skills and experience needed to found another high-growth company in the future. So yes, sure startups are great, but you know what is even better? Startups that grow. Unfortunately, the Dutch startups don’t. Here are some sobering stats from the report: more than 70% of all Dutch startups will never exit the seed stage, and only 19% of them will ever receive more than 10M EUR in funding. The Dutch are already not a champion in generating patents or turning patents into research-based startups (spin-offs). Even if formed, these spin-offs don’t grow either. Nearly 50% of Dutch spin-off companies that survive 15 years have less than 10 employees and only 18% have above 50. After these 15 years, 60% of spin-offs were still privately held. Dreaming of impacting the world with application of your research? Then you may have to wake up. Spin-off companies by age and company status. Taken from State of Dutch Tech 2024 report. Unfortunately, chances of you making it big as a founder in the Netherlands are relatively slim. As it turns out, even if you are one of the lucky ones who gets to grow, it will be slow. Median time to reach series A in the Netherlands (4 years) is double that of the US. The time to reach series C is 8 years, which is 3 and 2 years longer than in the US and EU respectively. Median time to reach a given funding round in the Netherlands, US and the EU. Taken from State of Dutch Tech 2024 report. Problem 2: Big money is hard to get (in NL) It is not any news that European VC funding is lagging the US one. The EU’s per capita VC investment is one eighth of that in the US and the Netherlands is not an outlier. It is getting better, but only very slowly. Additionally, 2023 was not an easy year, with VC funding experiencing a drop of 36% and 38% in the EU and US respectively. Many VCs report LPs delaying or reducing investments. Consequently, the Dutch and European VCs are cautious. That’s exactly the opposite of what Europe needs. VCs are experiencing difficulties sourcing capital from LPs. Taken from State of Dutch Tech 2024 report. This has several consequences. First, scarcity of capital makes it yet harder for companies to scale. Second, it creates more opportunities for foreign, non-European (e.g. US or Chinese), capital to enter the picture. While this is not immediately a bad thing, it does mean that part of the value created by successful companies will be captured outside of Europe, only exacerbating the problem in the future. In fact, between 2019 and 2023, 85% of all growth equity in the Netherlands included a foreign investment already. While big money is never easy to get, it is harder in the Netherlands than some other places in Europe and certainly much harder than it is in the US. In the Netherlands, only 1.3% companies raised 100+M EUR investments, whereas this is 2.8% in Germany, 2.1% in Switzerland and 1.9% in the UK. Maybe the lack of big money in the Netherlands should not be a surprise given that the phrase “going Dutch” has been around since the 17th century? Problem 3: The Netherlands is not a top destination for global talent The US has high salaries, the UK has a global metropolis and the comfort of an English-speaking country, Ireland has low taxes, Switzerland has high salaries, low taxes, and the Alps. The Netherlands has … weed? rain? tax policies that violate the European Convention on Human Rights? While I hate to admit it, the Netherlands is simply not a top destination for foreign talent.

&lt;p&gt;Writing a cover letter is like cooking for a date who is also a reviewer on the Michelin-star guide. You want to impress them but have no idea how – should you stand out with something creative? Probably not, they have seen it all. Or would they appreciate something authentic? Maybe, but it could turn out to be too simple. Unfortunately, cover letters are the necessary evil of job hunting. There are times in almost everyone’s career when we get to write one (and, sadly, usually many more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you write a good cover letter? There are plenty of resources suggesting what to write about, but that apparently does not stop many people from writing abysmally bad ones. My suggestion here is that you can improve your cover letter by choosing things &lt;strong&gt;that you are &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; going to avoid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-avoid-in-a-cover-letter&quot;&gt;What to avoid in a cover letter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should you avoid? &lt;strong&gt;Playing yourself down and showering the company with generic praise.&lt;/strong&gt; That seems straightforward, but is apparently hard to do for quite a number of people. Consider the following evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am doing a PhD in a fairly prestigious group that receives a lot of applications that are geographically well distributed. My PI forwards the full application pack to everyone in the group, and, as a consequence, I got the chance to read some 30+ cover letters over the past few years. Here are some excerpts that I gathered from these letters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As such a reputable lab in the ﬁeld, it would both be a resource and an honour to receive your supervision […]”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I knew your research and wanted to join your group when I was a master student many years ago. [n]ow, I am thrilled to know that a postdoc position […] is available. I choose to contact you without any hesitation. I sincerely want to pursue a professional science-related career in your laboratory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To summarise, working on such an original and innovative project in a multidisciplinary environment would be an opportunity I would wholeheartedly dedicate myself to. Spending the next few years in [your laboratory] would be an honour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am sincerely motivated to reach out to you, as I aspire to join your lab. I perceive your research as a pinnacle to strive for […]”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I hope I can have the chance to meet you virtually, in order to show you better my passion and love for science and my motivation to get in touch with your research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements all come from different cover letters, written by both prospective postdocs and graduate students. They all tick boxes for generic compliments and tons of servility. I don’t know about you, but these statements don’t make me want to hire this person – rather they make me pity them. One would almost think that the poor applicant’s life and ability to pay rent is entirely dependent on the generosity and benevolence of the mighty PI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume these statements don’t look that bad when you write them in the context of a motivation letter. However, singled out like this, it becomes quite clear that they are not helping you get a job, unless it’s a job with an egomaniac boss.[^1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-now-know-what-to-avoid-what-are-you-going-to-write-instead&quot;&gt;You now know what to avoid. What are you going to write instead?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what should you do instead? &lt;strong&gt;One&lt;/strong&gt;, drop blank-statement compliments and replace them with specifics about projects the company or group runs. &lt;strong&gt;Two&lt;/strong&gt;, scan your cover letter for signs of exaggerated subservience and weed them out. Then, connect one and two by highlighting how your previous achievements and the way you obtained them make you a great candidate for typical projects of this group or company. Remember, you already have a lot of value, and your cover letter is your chance to show that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="career" /><summary type="html">A photo by Andrea Piacquadio on Pexels.
